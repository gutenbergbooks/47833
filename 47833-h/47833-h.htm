<h2>ON LEPROSY AND LEPER HOSPITALS<br />

<small>IN SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></small></h2>

<h3>PART I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Few</span> subjects in pathology are more curious, and at the same time
more obscure, than the changes which, in the course of ages, have
taken place in the diseases incident either to the human race at
large, or to particular divisions and communities of it.</p>

<p>A great proportion of the maladies to which mankind are liable
have, it is true, remained entirely unaltered in their character and
consequences from the earliest periods of medical history down to
the present day. Synocha, Gout, and Epilepsy, for instance, show
the same symptoms and course now, as the writings of Hippocrates
describe them to have presented to him upwards of two thousand
years ago. The <i>generatio de novo</i> of a really new species of disease
&#8220;is (says Dr. Mason Good<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>) perhaps as much a phenomenon as
a really new species of plant or of animal&#8221; Dr. Good&#8217;s remark is
probably too sweeping in its principle; for, if necessary, it might
be easy to show that, if the particular diseases of particular animal
species are liable to alteration at all, they must necessarily alter
more frequently than those animal species themselves. In pursuing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>such an inquiry, the pathologist labours under comparative disadvantages.
The physiologist can, by the aid of geological research,
prove that the individual species of plants and animals inhabiting
this and other regions of the earth, have again and again been
changed. The pathologist has no such demonstrative data to show
that, in the course of time, the forms and species of morbid action
have undergone great mutations, like the forms and species of normal
life. But still we have strong grounds for believing that, in
regard to our own individual species alone, the diseases to which
mankind are subject have already undergone, in some respects,
marked changes within the historic era of medicine. Since the first
medical observations that are now extant on disease were made and
recorded in Greece, various new species of human maladies have,
there can be little doubt, made their original appearance. I need
only allude to small-pox, measles, and hooping-cough. Again, some
diseases which prevailed formerly, seem to have now entirely disappeared
from among the human race&mdash;as, for example, the Lycanthropia
of the Sacred Writings, and of Oribasius, Aetius, Marcellus,
and various old medical authors.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Other maladies, as that most
anomalous affection, the English sweating-sickness of the fifteenth
century, have only once, and that for a very short period, been permitted
to commit their ravages upon mankind. And lastly, we
have still another and more extensive class, including maladies that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>have changed their geographical stations to such an extent, as to
have made inroads upon whole districts and regions of the world,
where they were formerly unknown, leaving now untouched the
localities which, in older times, suffered most severely from their
visitations.</p>

<p>Among this last tribe of diseases no one presents a more
curious subject of inquiry than the European leprosy, or tubercular
elephantiasis of the middle ages. This malady is now almost entirely,
if not entirely, unknown as a native endemic disease on any
part of the Continent of Europe; and yet from the tenth to the
sixteenth century it prevailed in nearly every district of it. Laws
were enacted by Princes and Courts to arrest its diffusion;&mdash;the
Pope issued bulls with regard to the ecclesiastical separation and
rights of the infected;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>&mdash;a particular order of Knighthood was instituted
to watch over the sick;&mdash;and leper hospitals or lazar-houses
were everywhere instituted to receive the victims of the
disease. The number of these houses has certainly been often
erroneously stated, in consequence, as far as I have been able to
trace it, of a strange mistake committed by Ducange, in quoting
from Matthew Paris a passage in which that historian contrasts
the respective possessions belonging in the thirteenth century to
the Hospitalarii, Knights Hospitallers, or Knights of St.&nbsp;John, as
they were termed, and the Knights Templars. The 19,000 lazar-houses
in Christendom, as interpreted by Ducange, mark in Matthew
Paris&#8217; work merely the number of manors or commanderies of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>Hospitalarii, and have no reference whatever to leprosy or lazar-houses.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
But still that an immense number of leper-houses existed
on the Continent at the period mentioned, is abundantly shown in
many of the historical documents of that age. Louis VIII. promulgated
a code of laws in 1226, for the regulation of the French leper
hospitals; and these hospitals were at that date computed to amount,
in the then limited kingdom of France, to not less than 2000 in
number&mdash;(<i>deux mille leproseries</i>).<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> They afterwards, as is alleged
by Velley,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> even increased in number, so much so that there was
scarcely a town or burgh in the country that was not provided
with a leper hospital. In his history of the reign of Philip II.
Mezeray uses the same language in regard to the prevalence of
leprosy and leprous patients in France during the twelfth century.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
Muratori gives a nearly similar account of the extent of the disease
during the middle ages in Italy;<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> and the inhabitants of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>kingdoms of Northern Europe, equally became its unfortunate
victims.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>I have no desire, however, to enter at present into the extensive
history of the leprosy of the middle ages, as seen in the different
quarters of Europe. My object is a much more limited and a
much more humble one. I wish only to adduce various evidence
to show that the disease extended to this the most western verge
of Europe, and at one time prevailed to a considerable extent in
our own kingdom of Scotland, which, at the period alluded to,
was one of the most remote and thinly-populated principalities in
Christendom. I shall have frequent occasion, at the same time,
to illustrate my remarks by references to the disease as it existed
contemporaneously in England.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>In following out the object adverted to, I shall commence by
an enumeration of such leper hospitals as I have detected any
notices of in old Scottish records. The knowledge of the mere
existence of most of these hospitals has been obtained more by
the accidental preservation of charters of casual grants to them
than by any historical or traditional notice of the institutions
themselves. The information, therefore, which I have to offer in
regard to most of them is exceedingly slight. The following
meagre notes regarding the two first Lazar or Leper-houses, Spitals,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>Spetels, or Spitles,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> which I shall mention, show the truth of this
remark.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Scottish Leper Hospitals.</span></p>

<p><i>Aldcambus, Berwickshire.</i>&mdash;A Leper Hospital existed at Aldcambus,
in the parish of Cockburnspath, Berwickshire, as far back
as the reign of William the Lion.</p>

<p>In the Chartulary of the Priory of Coldingham is preserved a
charter by which that monarch confirms a grant of half a carrucate
of land to this hospital. I shall give a transcript of the charter,
which has hitherto remained unpublished. I do so that it may
serve as a fair specimen of the various similar charter documents
to which I shall have occasion to allude in the course of the
following remarks. It is entitled &#8220;Confirmatio donationis
Hospitali de Aldcambus facta:&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Willelmus Dei gratia Rex
Scottorum omnibus probis hominibus totius terre sue Clericis et
laicis salutem. Sciant presentes et futuri me concessisse, et
hac cart&acirc; me&acirc; confirmasse donationem illam, quam David de
Quicheswde fecit Hospitali de Aldcambus et Leprosis ibi manentibus,
de illa dimidia carucata terr&aelig; in Aldcambus quam Radulfus
Pelliparius tenuit: tenendam in liberam et puram et perpetuam
eleemosinam, cum omnibus libertatibus et aisiamentis ad predictam
terram juste pertinentibus, ita liber&eacute; et quiet&eacute; sicut carta predicti
Davidis testatur: Salvo servicio meo. Testibus Willelmo de Bosch.
Cancellario meo, Waltero Cuming, Davide de Hastings. Appud
Jeddewrith, xvi. die Maij.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p><p><i>Aldnestun in Lauderdale.</i>&mdash;At Aldneston another leper-house
existed. It was under the control of the Abbey of Melrose.
In the Melrose Chartulary there is preserved a charter headed
&#8220;Carta Leprosorum de Moricestun&#8221; In this charter, Walter
Fitzallan, Steward of Scotland, granted to this hospital of Auldnestun
and its inmates (Hospitali de Auldnestun et infirmis
fratribus ibidem residentibus), a carrucate and a half of land in the
village of Auldnestun; another carrucate and a half, which Dame
Emma of Ednaham held (tenuit per suas rectas divisas), with the
common pasturage and easement (asiamento) of the forests of
Birkenside and Ligarrdewude (Legerwood), and a right to grind at
his mill without paying multure.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p><i>Kingcase, Ayrshire.</i>&mdash;At Kilcais or Kingcase, on a bleak muir
in the parish of Prestwick, and about two miles from the town of
Ayr, stood, for several centuries, an hospital for Lepers. The
general tradition of the surrounding country avers that this hospital
was founded by King Robert the Bruce. In the article on Ayr,
recently published by the Rev. Dr. Auld and Mr. Cuthill, in the
New Statistical Account of Scotland,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> the foundation charter of
Robert Bruce is said to have been purchased by the Magistrates of
that town in 1786. I am obligingly assured, however, by Mr.
Murdoch of Ayr, that no such document is known to exist among
the archives of that town. It is probable that the hospital existed
before the time of Bruce. In a charter to the monastery of Dalmulin,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
contained in the Chartulary of Paisley Abbey,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> and of the
date of the reign of William I. of Scotland, among other lands and
localities in Kyle and the immediate neighbourhood of Kingcase,
the term Spetel-Crag occurs. Now the term Spetel was a prefix
applied, both in Scotland and England, to all hospital lands and
possessions, and to these alone; and history records no other
hospital whatever in Kyle, from which this appellation of Spetel
Craigs could be derived. But whether Bruce was the original
founder, or, what is more probable, a liberal endower of the
hospital, we know this at least of the history of the Kingcase Leper
Hospital, that it possessed at one time pretty extensive lands and
property in the parish of Dundonald, and in Kyle Stewart.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>These, like many other hospital grants, came after a time to be
perverted from their original objects of charity, and applied to
the aggrandisement of particular individuals. Thus the family
of Wallace of Newton obtained from James II. a feu-charter of
the Kingcase estate of Spittalshiels, for the annual payment of
eight merks Scots, and sixteen thrave of straw. In reference to
this, the land of Spittalshiels has yet (observes Sir Walter Scott,
in a note to his <i>Lord of the Isles</i><a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>) to give, if required, a quantity
of straw for the lepers&#8217; beds of Kingcase, and so much to thatch
their houses. Along with Spittalshiels the Wallaces acquired the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>office of Hereditary Keeper or Governor of the Hospital itself,
and of the other lands pertaining to it. In the family of the
Wallaces of Craigy this right of patronage and presentation to
Kingcase was long held, with all the remaining endowments of the
hospital. These privileges were exposed at a judicial sale of the
estate of Craigy, and purchased, 1784, by the burgh of Ayr, for
&pound;300. The magistrates, from this right, exact feu-duties from the
lands formerly belonging to Kingcase, to the annual extent of
sixty-four bolls oatmeal, and eight merks Scots money. This
revenue has been made over to the poor&#8217;s house of Ayr. In virtue
of it the magistrates have the privilege of presenting a certain
number of inmates to this latter institution.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>No records remain as to the original extent of the Kilcais
Hospital. The number of lepers supported was, during the latter
years of the institution, limited to eight. Before the hospital
revenues and lands were despoiled the number might have been
greater. The only remnants of the buildings which are now left
consist of the massive side-wall of a house 36 feet long and 17
wide. This is generally alleged to be the ruins of the chapel
merely of the hospital; and under this view it is certainly calculated
to give us a high opinion of the ancient extent and endowments
of the institution. Sir Robert Gordon, in a description of
Kyle, published in 1654, in Bleau&#8217;s <i>Atlas</i>, states that the persons
admitted to the charity were then lodged in huts (<i>tuguria</i>) in the
vicinity of the chapel.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p><p><i>Glasgow.</i>&mdash;In 1350, in the reign of David II., the Lady of
Lochow, daughter of Robert Duke of Albany, erected a leper
hospital at the Gorbals of Glasgow, near the old Bridge.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> She
endowed this hospital with some lands and houses in the city.
The magistrates of Glasgow seem to have exercised the privilege
both of searching for lepers among the inhabitants, and of consigning
them to this hospital. From the Burgh Records, presented
some time ago by Mr. Smith to the Maitland Club, it appears that
in 1573 the magistrates ordained four persons, named as lepers,
&#8220;to be viseit (inspected), and gif they be fund so, to be secludit of
the town to the Hospital at the Brigend.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> A similar edict was
issued in regard to two other individuals in 1575,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> and in 1581
eight more seem to have been dealt with in the same manner.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
The Bishops of Glasgow appear also to have had a right to present
patients to the hospital. In 1464, Andrew Muirhead, who then
held the bishoprick, availed himself of the privilege by presenting
one patient.</p>

<p>On the 9th August 1589, a report was given in to the magistrates
of Glasgow, stating that six lepers were at that time in the
house.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> As late as 1664, the ground-rents of this hospital were uplifted
by the water-bailie, an official who, according to an entry in
the city records of Glasgow, was in the custom of giving in annually
the number of lepers in the hospital at the Brigend. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>hospital, like that of Kingcase, was dedicated to the Gallovidian
Saint, St.&nbsp;Ninian.</p>

<p><i>Edinburgh.</i>&mdash;A leper hospital formerly existed at Greenside,
which was then a suburb, and not, as now, a constituent part of
the city of Edinburgh. The history of the hospital and its laws
are preserved in the Town-Council records. In 1584 the city
Magistrates issued orders for finding a commodious place for a
leper-house.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> In 1589, they passed an Act for building such an
institution at Greenside, and apparently with money granted to
them for that purpose, by John Robertson, a merchant in Edinburgh,
and others, in pursuance of some previous vow.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> On the
23d November 1591, five leper inhabitants of the city were consigned
to this hospital.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Two of the wives of the lepers voluntarily
shut themselves up in the hospital along with their diseased
husbands. I shall afterwards recur to the strict laws which the
inmates were bound to observe. In a charter of rights given to
the city in 1636 by Charles I. there are enumerated among the
other grants which he confirms to them, &#8220;the lands of old called
the Greenside, with the leper-house and yard situate on the same,
arable lands, banks, and marishes thereof, for the present occu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>pied
by the lepers of the said house.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> The hospital, however,
does not appear to have been of long duration. In 1652, the magistrates
ordered that the roof of the leper-house be taken off, and
its wood, slates, etc. used to repair the town milns and other public
buildings;<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and in 1657, a similar appropriation was made of the
stones contained in the walls of the leper-house, and in the fence
around its yard or garden.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p><i>Aberdeen.</i>&mdash;In an old manuscript <i>Description of bothe Touns of
Aberdeen</i>, by James Gordon, as quoted in the entertaining <i>Book of
Bon Accord</i>, the following notice of a leper hospital at Aberdeen
occurs:<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> &#8220;Such as go out at the Gallowgate port towards Old Aberdeen,
haff way almost, may see the place where of old stood the
lepers&#8217; hospital, called the seick-house, hard by the way syde. To
which there was a chappell adjoyned, dedicated to St.&nbsp;Anna,
quhome the Papists account patronesse of the lepers. The citizens
licencit one Mr. Alexander Galloway, the person of Kinkell, for to
build that chappell anno 1519. Now both these buildings are gone,
and scarcely is the name knowne to many&#8221; &#8220;On the 18th August
1574, the Regent Morton, and the Lords of the Privy-Council commanded
the Magistrates of Aberdeen to uptake fra James Leslie,
present possessioure of the croft and myre pertening to the Lipperfolk,
the yeirle dewtie tharof off the five yeiris bypast; and thairvith,
and sic vthir collectioune as may be hade, to caus the said
house be theikkit (thatched, roofed) and reparit for the resett of
the said Lipperfolk in tym cuming: and to caus roup the said croft
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>and myre, to quha vill giff maist yeirle dewtie tharfor fra thre yeir

upolding of the said hous, and sustentation of the Liperfolks that
salbe tharin.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>In the beginning of the eighteenth century the hospital and
grounds were sold under the direction of the magistrates, and the
money received appropriated to the establishment of a fund for a
proposed lunatic asylum. The leper croft now belongs to King&#8217;s
College.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p><i>Rothfan, Elgin.</i>&mdash;A leper-house seems to have existed from an
early period at Rothfan, near Elgin. John Byseth made a gift to
this hospital at Rothfan of the Church of Kyltalargyn, for the
avowed purpose of maintaining seven lepers, a servant and chaplain.
The donor retained to himself and his successors the privilege of
preserving the number complete, by filling up the vacancies. On
his request and presentation, William, prior of the hospital, was
admitted to the church in 1226.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>The precise date of Byseth&#8217;s charters is not preserved, but they
seem to have been drawn out during the reign of Alexander II.
or III. From their phraseology the hospital evidently was in existence
previous to that time.</p>

<p>The lands pertaining to this hospital are still known under the
name of the Leper Lands,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> though the institution itself has been
long obsolete.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span><i>Shetland.</i>&mdash;Lastly, we have records of several small and temporary
lazar-houses in Shetland. Thus, long ago, Brand (the honest
missionary, as Hibbert terms him) states that in that country
the &#8220;scurvy sometimes degenerates into leprosy, and is discerned
by hairs falling from the eyebrows, the nose falling in, etc., which&#8221;
(he adds), &#8220;when the people come to know, they separate and
set them apart for fear of infection, building huts or little houses
for them in the field. I saw the ruines of one of these houses
about half-a-mile from Lerwick, where a woman was for some years
kept for this reason. These scorbutick persons are more ordinarily
in Dunrossness and Delton, and more rare in other places.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Formerly&#8221; (says Dr. Edmondston, another and more recent
author on the Shetlands), &#8220;when leprosy was very prevalent, the
unfortunate individuals who were seized with it were removed to
small huts erected for the purpose, and there received a scanty
allowance of provisions daily, until the disease put a period to
their miserable existence.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Number of Hospitals, and Extent of the Disease.</span></p>

<p>The Scottish lazar-houses that I have thus enumerated, though
few in number, are still sufficient to show that the disease for
which they were instituted was generally diffused over the extent
of the kingdom. Thus, we have found the establishments in
question spread from Berwickshire to Shetland, and from Aberdeen
to Ayr. More research than I have been able to bestow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>upon the matter would no doubt bring to light notices of various
additional hospitals. In some Scottish towns names and notices
still exist sufficient to lead to the probability of lazar-houses
having formerly existed in them, though that evidence is in other
respects altogether incomplete.</p>

<p>In the immediate neighbourhood of Edinburgh a leper station
probably existed at a date greatly earlier than that of the Greenside
Hospital. In his <i>Caledonia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> the late excellent antiquary
and philologist, George Chalmers, expresses his belief in the
opinion suggested by the Rev. Mr. White, that the name of the
village of Liberton (two miles south of Edinburgh) is merely a corruption
of Liper town,&mdash;liper being the old Scotch term for leprosy;
and, as is well known, the letters <i>p</i> and <i>b</i> being constantly
interchanged for one another in the composition and transmutation
of words. This idea is certainly in no small degree countenanced
by the circumstance that the lands of Upper Liberton (Libertune)
in some old writs are described under the name of &#8220;terrarum de
Spittle town&#8221; (Hospital town.)<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>Besides, the &#8220;Oily or Balm Well of St.&nbsp;Catherine&#8217;s at Liberton,&#8221;
had been long held in high estimation in curing cutaneous diseases,
and still maintained great repute as late as the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. In his brief but interesting <i>Cosmography
and Description of Albion</i>, Boece, Canon of Aberdeen, at the
commencement of the sixteenth century, states that the oil of this
well &#8220;valet contra varias cutis scabricies.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Histori&aelig; Scotorum</i>
(1526), p. xi.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p><p>J. Monipennie alleges that its oil or &#8220;fatness is of a sudain
operation to heal all salt scabs and humors that trouble the outward
skin of man.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> Dr. Hare makes mention of it to the same
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> After the institution of the monastery of St.&nbsp;Catherine
of Sienna (<i>Scottic&eacute;</i>, Sheens) on the Burrow Moor, at a short distance
south of the city walls of Edinburgh, the Dominican nuns belonging
to it made, in honour of St.&nbsp;Catherine, an annual solemn procession
to the chapel and balm well of Liberton.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>This &#8220;oily or balm well&#8221; of Liberton was sufficient to excite
the admiration and engage the protective care of the credulous
King James VI. In a curious monograph<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> on the virtues of the
well, published at Edinburgh in 1664, the author, &#8220;Mathew Mackaile,
Chirurgo-Medicine,&#8221;  indulges himself (p. 117) in the following
historical eulogium and anathema in regard to it:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;His Majesty King James the Sixth, the first monarch of
Great Britain, of blessed memory, had such a great estimation of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>this rare well, that when he returned from England to visit this his
ancient kingdom of Scotland in anno 1617, he went in person to
see it, and ordered that it should be built with stones from the bottom
to the top, and that a door and a pair of stairs should be made
for it, that men might have the more easie access unto its bottom
for getting of the oyl. This royal command being obeyed, the well
was adorned and preserved, until the year 1650, when that execrable
regicide and usurper, Oliver Cromwell, with his rebellious and sacrilegious
accomplices, did invade this kingdom, and not only deface
such rare and ancient monuments of Nature&#8217;s handwork, but also
the synagogues of the God of nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it is unnecessary to insist further upon such problematical
evidence in regard to the probable extent and prevalence of the
disease in Scotland. A proof of this, of a much stronger character,
is afforded by the simple fact that, as late as the reign of James I.
the victims of the disease were made the subject of a direct and
special legislative enactment in the Scottish Parliament held at
Perth in the year 1427. I shall quote one short clause from this
act &#8220;anent Lipper Folke&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> (as it is termed), to illustrate both the
apparent prevalence of the malady at that time, and this circumstance,
that the burghs of the kingdom are then spoken of as possessing,
or obliged to possess, lazar-houses of their own. The second
clause is to the following effect: &#8220;Item, that na Lipper Folke sit
to thig (beg) neither in kirk nor kirkzaird, nor other place within
the burrowes, but at their own hospital, and at the port of the
towne and other places outwith the burrowes.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>
<p>It is impossible to form any approach as to the number affected
in this country. The hospitals that I have enumerated do not
seem calculated to contain many patients. As we have already
seen, that of Ayr contained at least eight patients; Rothfan, seven;
five were admitted into the Greenside hospital at its first opening
in 1591; and in a report of the Glasgow hospital, submitted to the
magistrates in 1589, six lepers were reported as then belonging to
that institution. These data are entirely inadequate to draw any conclusion
from, and the more so, that here, as in England, the disease
was probably more extensively spread during the eleventh, twelfth,
and thirteenth centuries than afterwards; and it is exactly at that
remote period that all our Scottish records are most defective.</p>

<p>In these early times the very words employed to designate the
disease show its extent and severity. Somner, Lye, and Bosworth,
in their several Dictionaries of the old Anglo-Saxon language, all
quote the remarkable expression, &#8220;<i>seo mycle adl</i>,&#8221; &#8220;the mickle ail&#8221;
or great disease, as signifying &#8220;elephantiasis&#8221; or &#8220;leprosie;&#8221; and it
is worthy of observation, in reference to the same point, that the
delightful old French chronicler, Sir John Froissart, who visited
Scotland in the time of Robert II., applies, as we shall afterwards
see, the analogous term of &#8220;la grosse maladie&#8221; to one noted case of
leprosy in this country. Some further idea may be formed of the
frequency of the disease, at least in the border counties of Scotland,
when I state that, before the year 1200, there existed various hospitals
for the exclusive reception of lepers in the immediately adjoining
English counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, and
Durham. Three alone of these hospitals contained as many as
ninety-one lepers in all&mdash;viz. the hospital of Sherburne, near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Durham,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> contained sixty-five; St.&nbsp;Nicholas, Carlisle,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> contained
thirteen; and Bolton, in Northumberland, founded, as its charter<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
bears, by Robert de Roos, &#8220;pro salute animae meae et omnium
antecessorum et successorum meorum,&#8221; was endowed for other
thirteen.</p>

<p>I may here take the opportunity of stating that the labours of
different English antiquaries, and more particularly the investigations
of Leland, Dugdale, and Tanner, into the Monastic History of
England, tend to show that at an early period many leper-houses
were scattered over England and Wales. In searching through the
works of these authors, and more particularly through the late
splendid edition of the <i>Monasticon Anglicanum</i>, with the numerous
additions of Caley, Ellis, and Bandinel, I have found references to
between eighty and ninety English lazar-houses.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>In the second and third volumes of the <i>Monasticon Anglicanum</i>
(1st edition) above ninety<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> charters or other notices of English hospitals
are published, and of these twenty-one at least were hospitals
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>for the reception of lepers. Bloomefield<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> mentions eighteen leper-houses
in Norfolk alone; and Taylor,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> in his <i>Index Monasticus</i>,
enumerates twenty in that single county. Six of these were placed
in Norwich or its immediate vicinity, and five at Lynne Regis.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Objects, Character, and Government of the Leper
Hospitals.</span></p>

<p>The leper hospitals, both in Scotland and elsewhere, were intended
merely as receptacles to seclude the infected, not as houses
in which a cure of them was to be attempted. They were charitable
and hygienic rather than medical institutions.</p>

<p>At the present day tubercular leprosy is still regarded as a
disease which sets at defiance all the powers of the medical art.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>Our ancestors had so firm a belief in the same doctrine, that, in
the case of one of the unfortunate wretches who was tried in
Edinburgh in 1597 for witchcraft, amongst the gravest of the
accusations brought against the panel was this, that she (Christian
Livingstone) &#8220;affirmit that she culd haill (cure) leprosie, quhilk
(the libel adds) the maist expert men in medicine are not abil to
do.&#8221; Some of the means of cure she had employed have never, I
am afraid, been allowed a place in any of our pharmacop&oelig;ias. I
may allude, therefore, as a specimen to one of them amongst
others&mdash;viz. (and I quote the words of the libel) &#8220;she took a reid
cock, slew it, baked a bannock (cake) with the blude of it, and gaf
(gave) the samyn to the Leper to eat.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>I leave it to the dogmatism of the pharmacologists to decide
whether more potent virtues should be ascribed to this recipe of
Christian Livingstone&#8217;s or to that deliberately offered with the
same purport by our celebrated countryman Michael Scott. &#8220;It
ought to be known&#8221; (says the great Fifeshire philosopher) &#8220;that the
blood of dogs and of infants two years old or under, when diffused
through a bath of heated water, dispels the Leprosy without a
doubt&#8221; (<i>absque dubio liberat Lepram</i>).<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>The miraculous properties of the relics of saints were in some
instances strongly relied upon as an article of the Materia Medica,
fit among other things to cure this incurable malady. Fosbroke<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
mentions a fountain near Moissac, described by Peyrat (abbot of
that place, in the fourteenth century), the waters of which were so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>medicated by the relics of a saint contained in the neighbouring
abbey that the crowds of lepers who resorted to it bathed and
were immediately cured. But the valued fountain was not
sufficiently powerful to avert the disease being communicated to
the monks, or to save them even when once they were contaminated;
and at last, according to the confessions of the abbot, it
was shut up in consequence of some of the order dying of the very
malady which their famed waters could infallibly remove.</p>

<p>In the sequel, when considering the causes of the disease, and
the regulations of medical police, adopted in regard to the infected,
I shall have occasion to speak at length of the strict rules to
which the inmates of most of the leper-hospitals were subjected&mdash;not
for the sake of medical treatment, but with the purpose only of
preventing the dissemination of the malady.</p>

<p>Besides being places for the isolation of the infected, the leper-hospitals
of Scotland and England were often, like the corresponding
institutions of the continent of Europe, founded and endowed
as religious establishments; and, as such, they were generally
submitted to the sway of some neighbouring abbey or monastery.
Semler<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> quotes, indeed, a Papal bull, appointing every leper-house
to be provided with its own churchyard,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> chapel, and
ecclesiastics&mdash;(cum cimiterio ecclesiam construere, et proprio
gaudere presbyterio)&mdash;an order against the latter part of which
the poverty of many of the hospitals in Great Britain formed a
very secure guarantee. The Greenside Hospital in Edinburgh,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>being founded at a very late period, partook, perhaps, less of
the character of a religious establishment than most others in the
kingdom.</p>

<p>The rules established for the domestic and religious duties of
the inmates belonging to it, by the commissioners appointed by the
magistrates of the city, were few and simple, viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the said persons, and ilk ane (every one) of thame leif
(live) quetlie, and gif (give) na sclander, be banning, sweyring,
flyting, skalding, filthie speaking, or vitious leving, or any oyder
way, under the paynes to be enjoynit by the counsall.</p>

<p>&#8220;That thair be appoyntit ane ordinair reider to reid the prayeris
evrie Sabboth to the said lepperis, and are commodious place
appoyntit to the said reider for that effect.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>Over some of our Scotch lazar-houses, chaplains, and religious
officers with the high-church title of priors, were placed.</p>

<p>The prior of Rothfan Hospital was, at the intercession of the
founder of the house, admitted to the church. There was one
chaplain under him.</p>

<p>In the records of the burgh of Prestwick there is an incidental
entry, showing that there was a prior placed over the Kingcase
Hospital near Ayr in 1507, for &#8220;George Yong, Prior of Kingiscase,
accusyt Thome Greif of four barrels of beyr, and the said Thomas
grantyt 24 shillings, but denyit ye beer.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> We have already seen
that there were chapels annexed to the Kingcase and Aberdeen
Hospitals. Our history of the other lazar-houses in Scotland is so
imperfect as not to enable us to state whether they were equally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>well provided; but certainly many of the richer leper and other
hospitals in England had, as appears from their better preserved
records, free chapels attached to them, with resident regular or
secular canons. In the Sherburne Leper Hospital, near Durham,
there were, besides the prior, four priests and four attendant
clerks.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> The hospital of St.&nbsp;Giles, Norwich, was provided with
a master or prior, and an establishment of eight regular canons
acting as chaplains, two clerks, seven choristers, and two sisters;
while the only permanent residents to whose wants they were
required to minister were eight poor bed-ridden subjects!<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>Both the ecclesiastical officers of the leper hospitals, and the
leprous inmates themselves, were in general strictly enjoined, by
the foundation charters and regulations of their institutions, to
observe strict religious formul&aelig;, and especially to offer up prayers
for the souls of the founder and his family. That the duties connected
with this last office were in some instances by no means
slight, will be sufficiently apparent by the following extract from
the laws of the leper hospital at Illeford, in Essex, which I translate
from the regulations established for the house in 1346 by Baldok,
Bishop of London:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>&#8220;We also command that the Lepers omit not attendance at
their church, to hear divine service, unless prevented by grievous
bodily infirmity; they are to preserve silence there, and hear matins
and mass throughout, if they are able; and whilst there, to be
intent on prayer and devotion, as far as their infirmity permits
them. We desire also and command that, as it was ordained of old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>in the said hospital, every leprous brother shall, every day, say for
the morning duty a Pater noster and Ave Maria, thirteen times;
and for the other hours of the day respectively, namely, the first,
third, sixth hour of the vespers, and again at the hour of the concluding
service, a Pater noster and Ave Maria seven times; and
besides the aforesaid prayers, each leprous brother shall say a Pater
and Ave thirty times every day for the founders of the hospital and
the bishop of the place, and all his benefactors, and all other true
believers, living or dead; and on the day on which any one of their
number departs from this life, let each leprous brother say in addition,
fifty Paters and Aves, three times, for the soul of the departed,
and the souls of all deceased believers. But if any one shall openly
(<i>manifeste</i>) transgress the said rules, or any one of them, for each
transgression let him receive a condign punishment according to
the amount of the offence, from the Master of the said hospital,
who is otherwise called the Prior. But if a leprous brother secretly
(<i>occult&egrave;</i>) fails in the performance of these articles, let him consult
the priest of the said hospital in the Penitential Court.&#8221;</p>

<p>In several of the hospitals the passions of the inmates were
endeavoured to be restrained by the laws laid down by their Superior.
Thus the articles of the leper-house of St.&nbsp;Julian, at St.&nbsp;Albans,
contain the following significant regulations of Abbot Michael <i>de
accessu Mulierum</i>. &#8220;And since by the access of women scandal
and evils of no slight nature arise, we above all things forbid that
any woman enter the hospital of the brothers, with the exception of
the common laundress of the house, who must be of mature age
and discreet manner of life (matur&aelig; aetatis et bonae conversationis),
so that no suspicion can attach to her. And she must not presume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
to enter the house at suspicious times, but at the proper hours, so
that her entrance and exit may be seen by all. But if a mother or
sister, or any other honest matron, come there for the purpose of
visiting the infirm, she may have access to the one with whom she
wishes to speak, and this may be done by the permission of the
Custos; without which they are not to enter, whatever may be their
rank. But women of light fame and evil reputation are by no
means to enter the houses.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>The Custos, Master, Dean or Prior, and in some houses the
Prioress,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> seems in general to have had full control over the leprous
inmates of the hospital. Thus, in the laws which have been transmitted
to us of the Sherburne Hospital, it is laid down that
members were to be punished for disobedience or idleness, at the
discretion of the prior, by corporal correction with the birch,
&#8220;<i>modo scholarium</i>.&#8221; Offenders who refused to submit to this chastisement
had their diet reduced to bread and water, and after the
third offence were liable to be ejected.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>Matthew Paris has left us a copy of the vow which the lepers
of the hospital of St.&nbsp;Julian, at St.&nbsp;Albans, were obliged to take before
admission. I append a translation of it as a document highly illustrative
of this part of our subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, brother B, promise and, taking my bodily oath by touching
the most sacred Gospel, affirm, before God and all his saints in this
church, which is constructed in honour of St.&nbsp;Julian the confessor,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>in the presence of Dominus R. the Archdeacon, that all the days of
my life I will be subservient and obedient to the commands of the
Lord Abbot of St.&nbsp;Albans for the time being, and to his archdeacon;
resisting them in nothing, unless such things should be commanded
as would militate against the Divine pleasure. I will never commit
theft, nor bring a false accusation against any one of the brethren,
nor infringe the vow of chastity, nor fail in my duty by appropriating
anything or leaving anything by will to others, unless by
a dispensation granted by the brothers. I will make it my study
wholly to avoid all kind of usury, as a monstrous thing, and hateful
to God.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> I will not be aiding and abetting, in word or thought,
directly or indirectly, in any plan by which any one shall be
appointed custos or master of the Lepers of St.&nbsp;Julian, except the
person appointed by the Lord Abbot of St.&nbsp;Albans. I will be content,
without strife or complaint, with the food and drink, and other
things given and allowed me by the master, according to the usage
and custom of the house. I will not transgress the bounds prescribed
to me, without the special license of my superiors, and with
their consent and will; and if I prove an offender against any
article named above, it is my wish that the Lord Abbot or his
substitute may punish me according to the nature and amount of
the offence, as shall seem best to him, and even to cast me forth
an apostate from the congregation of the brethren, without hope of
remission, except through the special grace of the Lord Abbot.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>I have only very briefly to advert to one other subject, before
closing these remarks on the government of the English leper
hospitals. I have already alluded to a special order of knighthood
having been established at an early period for the care and superintendence
of lepers. Belloy<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> carries back the origin of this order
in Palestine to a very early period in the history of the Christian
church. We know as a matter of greater historical certainty that
the knights of St.&nbsp;Lazarus separated from the general order of
Knights Hospitallers about the end of the eleventh or commencement
of the twelfth century.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>From the locality of their original establishment, and from
their central preceptory being near Jerusalem, they were at first
generally designated Knights of St.&nbsp;Lazarus, or of St.&nbsp;Lazarus and
St.&nbsp;Mary of Jerusalem. Latterly they were conjoined by different
European Princes with the Military Orders of Notre-Dame, Mount
Carmel, and St.&nbsp;Maurice.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>Saint Louis brought twelve of the Knights of St.&nbsp;Lazarus
into France, and entrusted them with the superintendence of the
Ladreries or leper hospitals of his kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> The first notice
of their having acquired a footing in Great Britain is in the time
of King Stephen. During the reign of that sovereign their head
establishment in England at Burton Lazars, Leicestershire, was
built by (as Nicols<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> states) a general collection throughout the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>kingdom, but chiefly by the assistance of Robert de Mowbray.
Here they gradually acquired considerable wealth and possessions.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>
I find that the Hospitals of Tilton, of the Holy Innocents
at Lincoln, of St.&nbsp;Giles, London, the Preceptory of Choseley in
Norfolk, and perhaps various others, were betimes annexed to
Burton Lazars as cells containing &#8220;fratres leprosos de Sancto
Lazaro de Jerusalem.&#8221; Nicols has printed not less than thirty-five
charters relating to the House of Burton Lazars. Its privileges
and possessions were confirmed by Henry II., King John,
and Henry VI. It was at last dissolved by Henry VIII.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> The
only settlement of the Knights of St.&nbsp;Lazarus in Scotland that I
have been able to find, was in the town of Linlithgow, and the
notice of it is very imperfect and unsatisfactory. It is contained
in a document of the reign of Alexander II., and preserved in the
Chartulary of Newbottle, in which reference is expressly made to
land held &#8220;de Fratribus de Sancto Lazaro&#8221; at Linlithgow.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> That
the Lazarites had an establishment or establishments in Scotland
as well as in the sister kingdom, appears borne out by a fact
recorded by Helyot,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> that in 1342, John Halliday, a Scotsman, was
appointed Governor of the Knights of St.&nbsp;Lazarus both in England
and Scotland, by the Grand Master of Boigny in France, who was
at that period the reputed head of the order. Indeed Pennecuik,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>on the authority of Maimbourg (<i>Histoire des Croisades</i>), asserts that
the &#8220;Knights of St.&nbsp;Lazarus were numerous everywhere, but especially
in Scotland and France.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>The first and original object of the Knights of St.&nbsp;Lazarus
seems to have been the care probably of the sick generally, but in
a special manner of those affected with leprosy.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> They received
lepers into their order, superintended the inmates of the lazar-houses,
and, till the standing rule to the contrary was allowed to be
changed by Pope Innocent IV., they were obliged to elect a leper
to be their Grand Master;<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> &#8220;eatenus consuetudine observat&acirc; ut
Miles leprosus dom&ucirc;s Sancti Lazari Hierosolymitani in ejus Magistrum
assumeretur.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>Toussaint de S. Luc, in his History, Ceremonials, etc., of the
Order of St.&nbsp;Lazarus, after it was united in 1608 by Henry IV. of
France to those of Notre-Dame and Mount Carmel, states that the
candidates for this united knighthood were obliged, upon the Holy
Evangelists, to swear <i>inter alia</i>, &#8220;to exercise charity and works of
mercy towards the poor, and particularly lepers&#8221; (<i>et particuli&egrave;rement
les lepreux</i>.)<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>What extent and what kind of sway, if any, the Lazarite
Knights of England and Scotland were ever allowed to exert over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>the lepers of the kingdom generally, or over the inmates of these
leper cells and hospitals that more especially belonged to them, I
have not been able to ascertain from any of the British historical
records of the middle ages that I have had an opportunity of consulting.
It is, however, only too probable that the Lazarites, like
most of the other early orders of knights, were induced by pride
and avarice to turn from their original objects of love and charity
to others,&mdash;to views of power and aggrandisement for themselves.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Extent of Endowment of the Hospitals, Diet, etc.</span></p>

<p>Most of the Scottish leper-houses were very poorly or not at
all endowed. Their principal subsistence seems to have been
derived from casual alms. Each of the doomed inmates of the
hospitals was, like the leper-struck heroine of the old Scottish
poet, Henryson, by</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><span class="gesperrt">....</span>cauld and hounger sair</div>
<div class="line">Compellit to be ane rank beggair.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The inmates of the Greenside or Edinburgh lazar-house were
allowed four shillings Scotch (about fourpence sterling) per week,
and for the remainder of their subsistence they were, according to
the original rules of the institution, obliged to beg at the gate of
their hospital.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> The leper-house at Aberdeen was supported from
the public funds of the town; but in 1591 James VI. granted a
charter to &#8220;Robert Abell and remanent of the pure (poor) leprous
personis and thair successors&#8221; in the hospital, to draw one peat of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>custom from every load of them brought to the markets of Aberdeen,
in consequence (as the words of the original charter bear)
&#8220;of the smallness of the rent appointit for the leprous personis in
the Hospitall being unable to sustene thame in meet and fyre,
quhairthrow they leif verie miserablie.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>Other Scottish lazar-houses, however, were comparatively
wealthy. Thus, I have already mentioned that the Kingcase
Hospital, near Ayr, had some large and extensive landed properties
attached to it.</p>

<p>The inmates of most of the smaller English leper-houses seem
also to have principally depended for their subsistence upon the
precarious contributions of the charitable. One of the lepers of
the hospital at Beccles was, by a royal grant, empowered to beg
for his leprous brothers.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> Several of the larger English hospitals,
however, were well endowed, and the food, clothing, etc., of the
inmates amply provided for.</p>

<p>In some instances these endowments consisted of the accumulations
of large and voluntary charities; in others they were
made up of rich grants, left for the avowed purpose of founding
chantries for the spiritual peace and pardon of the donor and his
family; and in other cases, again, they were originally obtained
as direct propitiations to the church for misconduct and crime.
Indulgences<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> of forty days&#8217; pardon seem to have been occasionally
granted by the bishops and other ecclesiastical dignitaries to all
the benefactors of the hospitals.</p>

<p>A bull of Pope Alexander III., which has been already referred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>to, granted all leper hospital possessions an exemption from the
payment of tithes.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> The canon was not universally adhered to
in England, for, in the account which Archbishop Parker drew
up in 1562 of the hospitals in the diocese of Canterbury, while
Herbaldone and Bobbing leper-houses are reported as &#8220;not charged
with the taxes of the tenths,&#8221; it is declared of the leper hospital
of St.&nbsp;Laurence, Canterbury, that &#8220;the same is taxed and payeth
the perpetual tenth.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>From the <i>Valor Ecclesiasticus</i>, taken in the time of Henry
VIII., it appears that whilst forty-eight hospitals, leper-houses,
and lazar-houses in the diocese of Norwich and county of Norfolk
possessed only a revenue of about &pound;158 in all,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> the rentals, on the
other hand, of certain individual hospitals were comparatively
great for that period. Thus, the revenues of Herbaldone<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> Hospital,
Kent, and St.&nbsp;James&#8217;, London,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> were each rated at &pound;100; of
Sherburne above &pound;140;<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> of Maiden Bradley at near &pound;200;<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
and those of the establishment and &#8220;veri fair hospital&#8221; (as
Leland terms it),<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> of Burton Lazars were valued above &pound;260.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>
In some of these richer institutions the inmates were, as I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>just remarked, well provided for. As illustrative of this, I may
quote the diet-table, etc., of one or two of the wealthier leper
hospitals. Thus, among the rules published in the Additamenta to
Matthew Paris, as established about the middle of the fourteenth
century by the Abbot Michaele for the leper-house of St.&nbsp;Julian,
near St.&nbsp;Albans, we find the following regulations laid down with
regard to the commons of the leprous brothers (de distributionibus
fratrum leprosorum):&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Let every leprous brother receive from the property of the
hospital, for his living and all necessaries, whatever he has been
accustomed to receive by the custom observed of old in the said
hospital, namely, every week seven loaves, of which five shall be
white and two brown, made from the grain as thrashed from the
ear; also, every seventh week, fourteen gallons of beer, or eight-pence
(octo denarios) for the same. Let him have, in addition to
this, on the feasts of all the saints, on the feast of Saint Julian, the
purification of the Blessed Mary, the Annunciation, the Trinity,
Saint Albans, Saint John the Baptist, the Assumption of the Blessed
Mary, and the Nativity of the same, for each feast, one loaf, one jar
of beer, or a penny for the same, and one obolus, which is called
the charity of the aforesaid hospital; also, let every leprous brother
receive, at the feast of Christmas, forty gallons of good beer, or
forty pence for the same. Also, let each receive on the said feast
his share of two quarters of pure and clean corn, which is called
the great charity. Also, at the feast of St.&nbsp;Martin, each leper shall
have one pig from the common stall, and that there may be a fair
division of the pigs amongst the brothers, according to the custom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>observed of old, we desire that the pigs, according to the number of
the lepers, may be brought forward in their presence, if it can conveniently
be done, otherwise in another place fit for the purpose,
and there each, according to the priority of entering the hospital,
shall choose one pig (otherwise a sum of money to be distributed
equal to the value of the pigs). Also, each leper shall receive on
the feast of Saint Valentine, for the whole of the ensuing year, one
quarter of oats. Also, about the feast of St.&nbsp;John Baptist, two
bushels of salt, or the current price. Also, at the feast of St.&nbsp;Julian,
and at the feast of St.&nbsp;Alban, one penny for the accustomed pittance.
Also, at Easter one penny, which is called by them &#8216;Flavvonespeni.&#8217;
Also, on Ascension-Day, one obolus for buying potherbs. Also, on
each Wednesday in Lent, bolted corn of the weight of one of their
loaves. Also, on the feast of St.&nbsp;John the Baptist, four shillings
for clothes. Also, at Christmas, let there be distributed in equal
portions among the leprous brothers, fourteen shillings for their
fuel through the year, as has been ordained of old for the sake of
peace and concord. Also, since, by the bounty of our Lord the
King, thirty shillings and fivepence have been assigned for ever for
the use of the lepers, which sum the Viscount of Hertford has to
pay them annually at the feasts of Easter and Michaelmas, we command
that the said 30s. and 5d. be equally divided among them in
the usual manner; and we desire the brothers to be contented with
the aforesaid distributions, which have been accustomed to be made
amongst the leprous brothers of old: But the residue of the property
of the said hospital we order and decree to be applied to the
support of the Master and Priests of the said Hospital.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dress of the lepers is laid down in regulations equally pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>cise.
&#8220;The brothers are to have a tunic and upper tunic of russet,
with a hood cut from the same, so that the sleeves of the tunic be
closed as far as the hand, but not laced with knots or thread after
the secular fashion. They are to wear the upper tunic closed down
to the ankles, and a close cape of black cloth, of the same length
with the hood, as they have been accustomed of old.&#8221; A particular
form of shoe was also ordered, and if the order was disobeyed, the
culprit was &#8220;condemned to walk daily barefooted until the Master,
considering his humility, said to him&mdash;enough.&#8221;&mdash;P. 168.</p>

<p>The diet-roll of the large hospital at Sherburne is still more
complex than that of St.&nbsp;Julian&#8217;s. I extract the heads of it, and
of some other particulars with regard to the internal economy of
the house, from Surtees&#8217; elaborate work, in which copies of the
original documents are given at full length.</p>

<p>The daily allowance of the lepers of Sherburne was a loaf weighing
five marks, and a gallon of ale to each; and betwixt every two,
one mess or commons of flesh three days in the week, and of fish,
cheese, or butter, on the remaining four; on high festival, a double
mess; and, in particular, on the feast of St.&nbsp;Cuthbert, in Lent, fresh
salmon (<i>salmones recentes</i>), if it could be had; if not, other fresh
fish; and on Michaelmas day four messed on one goose. With
fresh fish, flesh, or eggs, a measure of salt was delivered. When
fresh fish could not be had, red herrings (<i>allecia rubea</i>) were served
three to a single mess; (and it was specially enjoined that they, or
aught that was served up, was not to be putrid, nor corrupt, nor
from animals that had died of disease)<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>; or cheese and butter by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>weight; or three eggs. During Lent each had a razer (<i>rasarium</i>)
of wheat to make furmenty (<i>simulam</i>), and two razers of beans to
boil; sometimes greens or onions; and every day, except Sunday,
the seventh part of a razer of bean meal, but on Sunday a measure
and a half of pulse to make gruel. Red herrings were prohibited
from Pentecost to Michaelmas, and at the latter each received two
razers of apples. The lepers had a common kitchen, and a common
cook, fuel, and utensils for cooking, etc.&mdash;viz. a lead, two brazen
pots, a table, a large wooden vessel for washing or making wine, a
laver, two ale vats, and two bathing vats.</p>

<p>The sick had fire and candle, and all necessaries, until they
either convalesced or died; and one of the chaplains was assigned
to hear the confessions of the sick, to read the gospel to them on
Sundays and holidays, and to read the burial-service for the dead.
The old woman who attended on the sick had every week three
wheaten loaves, and one mess of flesh or fish; and when a brother
or sister was buried, the grave-digger had his meat and drink.
Each leper had a yearly allowance for his clothing of three yards
of woollen cloth, white or russet, six yards of linen, and six of canvass,
and the tailor had his meat and drink the day on which he
came to cut out their clothes. Four fires were allowed for the
whole community. From Michaelmas to All Saints they had two
baskets of peat on double mess days, and four baskets daily from
All Saints to Easter. On Christmas eve they had four yule logs,
each a cart-load (&#8220;unusquisque erit unius quadrigatae&#8221;), with four
trusses of straw; four trusses of straw on All Saints eve and Easter
eve; and four bundles of rushes on the eves of Pentecost, St.&nbsp;John
Baptist, and St.&nbsp;Mary Magdalene; and on the anniversary of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Martin de Sancta Cruce, every leper received five shillings and fivepence
in money.</p>

<p>The good food, lodging, and raiment provided by the rich
endowments of Sherburne were not without some alloy. The
rules of the house were strict, and the religious duties enforced
upon the inmates were of an austere character. &#8220;All the leprous
brethren, whose health permitted, were every day expected to attend
matins, nones, vespers, and complines. The bed-rid sick were
enjoined to raise themselves, and say matins in their bed; and for
those who were still weaker, let them rest in peace, <i>et quod dicere

required to receive corporal discipline three days in the week, and
the sisters, in like manner, <i>donec omnes vapulent</i>. And all these,
and other laws, Bishop Kellaw &#8220;did by his charter confirm and
order ever thereafter &#8216;<i>inviolabiter observari</i>.&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p class="tb">On the Continent the lazar hospitals partook of the same differences
in regard to poverty and wealth as we have traced in Britain.
In France, some of them, however, had become so very amply endowed
by the commencement of the fourteenth century that they
at last excited the avarice of Philip V., who subjected many of their
inmates to the flames.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> &#8220;They were burned alive&#8221; (<i>on les bruloit tout
vifs</i>), says the historian Mezeray, &#8220;in order that the fire might purify
at one and the same time the infection of the body and that of the
soul.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> The ostensible cause for this act of fiendish barbarity was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>the absurd allegation, that (as the original ordonnance of Philip
bears<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>) the lepers of France and other parts had been bribed to
commit &#8220;the detestable sin and horrible crime&#8221; (detestabile flagitium
et crimen horrendum) of poisoning the wells, waters, etc., used by
the Christians. The real cause, there is little doubt, was a desire,
through this flimsy excuse, to rob the richer hospitals of their
funds and possessions; and this appears only too strongly in the
anxiety displayed in the special wording of Philip&#8217;s original edict,
that all the goods of the lepers be lodged and held for himself,
(ordinavimus, <i>inter alia</i>, quod omnia bona eorum ad manum nostrum
ponerentur et tenerentur.)<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> The persecution of them was
again temporarily renewed in 1388, under Charles VI. of France.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Dates of the Appearance and Disappearance of Leprosy
in Great Britain.</span></p>

<p>Much has been written regarding the date of the first appearance
of Leprosy in western Europe.</p>

<p>By Astruc,<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> Bach,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> and others, it has been averred that the
leprosy of the middle ages was introduced from the East by those
who returned from the crusades. Some of our own historians, as
Fuller<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> and Heron,<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> allege that by this means it first reached
Great Britain. It is quite possible, allowing the disease for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>sake of argument to be contagious, that through the increased international
intercourse of that period, it may have been propagated
more rapidly and widely than would otherwise have occurred; but
there are ample reasons and proofs for believing that it existed on
the continent of Europe, and even as far westward as England, before
the crusade fanaticism had drawn any converts from this
country.</p>

<p>The first relay of Englishmen engaged in the crusade left in
1096, and returned two years afterwards. Several English leper-houses
were founded before that period.</p>

<p>Lanfranc, Bishop of Canterbury, and the ecclesiastical favourite
of William the Conqueror, died, according to the evidence of the
Saxon Chronicle in 1089,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> seven years previous to the first crusade.
During his lifetime he founded two hospitals near Canterbury, one
a house built of stone (lapideum domum decentem et amplum) for
patients affected with various descriptions of diseases (variis infirmitatum
qualitatibus), and the second an hospital constructed of
houses of wood, and specially set aside for lepers (ligneas domos
ad opus leprosorum.)<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> Somner states that this latter institution
still exists at Canterbury as a charitable establishment.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> Other
English lazar-houses were probably of as early a date, or at least
earlier than the first emigration for the crusades. Brigges alleges
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>that the leper-house of St.&nbsp;Leonards in Northampton, was founded
in William I.&#8217;s reign,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> or before 1087; and one at Chatham was,
according to Tanner, in existence before the termination of the
short reign of his son, William Rufus.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p>But more than a century even previous to the date of which we
speak, leprosy had been made a subject of legislation in Great
Britain. In a parliament held by Pepin, King of France in 757 at
Campiegne, it was enacted that leprosy in a husband or wife be
regarded as a cause of separation, and that the sound party might
again remarry.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> Lobineau, in his history of Brittany,<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> tells us as
one of the effects of this law of divorce, that among the higher
ranks of the city of Dol, there were a number (<i>quantit&eacute;</i>) of husbands
who had as many as three wives living at the same time. Now
among the earliest extant code of laws enacted in any part of
Britain, those, namely, of the celebrated Welsh King, Hoel Dha,
who died about the year 950,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> there is a canon to the same effect
as that referred to, viz. that a married female was entitled to separation,
and the restitution of her goods, provided her husband was
affected with leprosy.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> There is, however, as we shall afterwards
see, great reason to believe that the word leprosy was then used as
a generic term, including under it many different varieties of cutaneous
affections.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p><p>I can offer nothing precise in regard to the exact period of the
first introduction of Leprosy into Scotland. If, as I have already
shown to be highly probable, the term Liberton is merely a conversion
from leper town, it would render it likely that the disease was
an early visitant of this country; for we know that Liberton is
mentioned in various old charters of the reign of David I., who died
in 1153.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> In the Foundation Charter of Holyrood (1128) the mill
and chapel &#8220;de Libertune&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> are mentioned, and in the chartulary of
Kelso, &#8220;William, parsona de Liberton,&#8221; signs as witness to some
charters dated during the latter half of the twelfth century.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> At
a later date there figures repeatedly, in the ancient and well-known
verses of Blind Harry, as an occasional companion of
Wallace&mdash;</p>

<p>a member of the church militant, who in more than one instance
seems to have thrown aside his bell and book for the purpose of
sharing in the brave struggles and hardy adventures of the Scottish
patriot.</p>

<p>But I can adduce much more solid proof than this unstable
philological basis affords, for stating that, as far back at least as the
latter half of the twelfth century, the disease was not only known
in Scotland, but that hospitals were by that time actually erected
for the seclusion of the victims of it. The hospital of Auldnestun,
in Lauderdale, had, as I have already stated, three carrucates of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>land granted to it, as appears from the Melrose Chartulary, by
Walter, the son of Alan. The date of this grant, as of most others
in the old chartularies, is not preserved, but it is a fixed and well-ascertained
fact in Scottish history that the donor of it, the first of
the illustrious, and afterwards royal line of Stewarts, died himself
as a Cluniac monk in Melrose Abbey in the year 1177.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>William the Lion, who died in 1214, confirmed, as we have
seen, a grant to the leper-house of Aldcambus; and the hospital of
Rothfan, near Elgin, was evidently established during, if not prior
to, the reign of his son and successor, Alexander II. In the chapter
of gifts to this Rothfan hospital, by John Byseth, Alexander is
spoken of as the reigning prince, the preamble to the grant declaring
that the endowment was bestowed &#8220;for the love of charity,
for the soul of King William, and for the salvation of my noble lord
King Alexander&#8221; (pro salute dominis mei Alexandri nobilis Regis).<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>
Alexander II. died in 1249, so that by this time the disease was
certainly spread to the more northern parts of the kingdom.</p>

<p>All Scottish records of these earlier times are almost, as I have
already observed, so entirely lost, that it now seems impossible to
ascertain whether any leper-houses existed in this kingdom at a
date antecedent to those to which I have thus alluded. That this
was the case, however, is not improbable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p><p>Before the first notice of the earliest Scotch leper-house that I
have been able to trace&mdash;viz. that of Auldnestun, about 1170,
similar establishments were abundant in England. The charters
of many of them appear to have been either granted or confirmed
in the reign of Henry I., who died in 1154, and was a contemporary
of the Scotch Kings, Edgar, Alexander I., and David I.; and
it is not unworthy of remark that two, if not more, lazar-houses
were founded in England by natives of Scotland prior to the date
of the earliest Scotch leper-house that I have been able to discover.
For Malcolm IV. founded and endowed one in his principality of
Huntingdon in 1165;<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> and sixty years earlier, or in 1101,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> Matilda,
the &#8220;gode Queene Maud&#8221; of Henry I., and daughter of Malcolm III.
of Scotland, established the hospital of St.&nbsp;Giles, Bishopsgate, for
forty lepers, a chaplain, clerk, and messengers.</p>

<p>But at whatever respective periods the disease first appeared in
England and Scotland, there are strong reasons for believing that
it continued to prevail in the latter kingdom long after it had
ceased, or almost entirely ceased, in the former. In the preface
to the statutes of the leper-house of St.&nbsp;Albans, drawn up about
1350, and already referred to as published in the supplement to
Matthew Paris&#8217; history,<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> it is stated that the number of lepers
that presented themselves for admission had diminished so much
by that time, that their expense of maintenance was below the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>revenue of the institution; &#8220;in general,&#8221; it is added, &#8220;there are
now not above three, sometimes only two, and occasionally only
one.&#8221; In exactly the same year (1350) that this report was drawn
up for St.&nbsp;Albans, was it thought necessary to institute the leper-house
at Glasgow; and nearly one hundred years later, or in 1427,
the Scottish Parliament deemed it proper to legislate on the
subject of lepers.</p>

<p>The hospital of St.&nbsp;Mary Magdalene, at Ripon, was established
in 1139 for the relief of all the lepers in that district. In the time
of Henry VIII, it contained only two priests and five poor people
to pray for all &#8220;Christen sowlez.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>At Illeford, in Essex, an hospital was instituted in the reign of
Henry II. or Richard I. for thirteen lepers. In one of the reports
of the commissioners for suppressing colleges, hospitals, etc., in the
time of Edward VI., it is observed, in regard to the state of this
Illeford Hospital, that though founded &#8220;to find 13 pore men beying
Lepers, 2 pryests, and one clerke&mdash;thereof there is at this day but
one pryest and 2 pore men.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>By the same commission most other lazar-houses were reported
as having no leprous patients, and yet only a few years previously
was the leper-house of Aberdeen built, and forty or fifty years
afterwards (in 1591) the Edinburgh hospital at Greenside was
established. We have several later notices of the disease among
us. In the Aberdeen Kirk-Session Register, vol. i., it is stated
that, on the 13th May 1604, the kirk-session ordained &#8220;Helene
Smythe, ane puir woman infectit with leprosie, to be put in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>hospitall appoyntit for keeping and haulding of lipper-folkis
betwixt the townis; and the keyis of the said hospitall to be
deliverit to her.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>As late as 1693 we have some records of the lepers of Kingcase.
On the 11th March of that year a complaint was lodged
by the procurator-fiscal &#8220;anent the intruding of the lepers of
Kingcase upon the priviledges only propper to the burgess and
freemen (of Prestwick) by there resorting to the shoar, and taking
up certain timber and other wrack, and casting greater quantities
of peats and turf off the common and moss, &amp;c., which, being
seriously pondered by the magistrates, &amp;c., they ordained that
none of the said lepers of Kingcase do so under the penalty of
ane hundredth pund, <i>toties quoties</i>, to be paid by ilk ane (each one)
of them in caise of failyie (failure).&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>The disease appears to have continued in the northern
islands of Scotland long after it had disappeared from the mainland,
and, indeed, all other parts of Great Britain. In Shetland
it has been known for centuries. I have already made a
quotation from Brand to show that it was at Lerwick as late as
the latter part of the seventeenth century. In some districts of
Shetland it continued still later. Apparently most of those there
affected either belonged to or were sent to the Island of Papa. I
have in my possession a MS. extract from the Session-books of
Walls, showing the expenses incurred in keeping the lepers at
Papa from 1736 to 1740. Four of them appear to have died
during these years, and two of the entries are for the &#8220;tobacco&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>used at their funerals. In 1742 there is a long entry in the
Session Records of Walls, earnestly enjoining a day of public
thanksgiving for the supposed total deliverance of the country
from the effects of the leprosy.</p>

<p>The disease, however, was not eradicated entirely. Mr. Jack,
the resident clergyman, who wrote the account of the parish of
Northmaven for the Statistical Account of Scotland, published in
1798, seems to have seen what he terms several miserable cases of
the disease, and adds, that in many instances there is reason to
suspect a hereditary taint.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> Dr. Thomson urged his pupil, Dr.
Edmondston of Lerwick, to trace out the history of the disease in
the north, and that gentleman has made the following observations
upon it in his work on the Zetland Isles:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Elephantiasis, known by the name of leprosy, was very frequent
in Zetland about sixty years ago, but its occurrence since
that time has only been occasional, and at present scarcely an instance
of it is to be met with. A native of Zetland, a few years
ago, was received into the hospital of Edinburgh, labouring under
true elephantiasis. I have seen obscure degrees of it in Zetland,
where the face was bloated, the skin scaly and rough, and the
voice slightly hoarse; but they did not terminate fatally, nor was
the affection apparently communicated to others. The last instance
I saw of it was in the person of a boy. His friends could assign
no cause for its appearance, and said that it had come on sponta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>neously,
and proceeded gradually. The disease had been stationary
for some time before it fell under my observation.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>As so far confirmatory of the disease having thus longer
remained in Shetland than in the more southern parts of these
kingdoms, I may here mention that in the middle ages it was very
common,<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> and has since long continued to linger in the neighbouring
Faroe Islands, and in Iceland. It appears, from Debes&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> evidence,
that true tubercular leprosy, as we shall see in the sequel,
continued to prevail in the Faroe Islands (the nearest land north
of Shetland) in the middle of the seventeenth century. Still later&mdash;viz.
in 1768, Petersen<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> found 280 lepers in the hospitals in
Iceland. Olafsen,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> Troil,<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> Holland,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> and Henderson,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> have each,
from personal observation, described the disease as existing in
that island; and the French Government expedition in 1836,
under Gaimard,<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> have, in the beautiful work they are at present
publishing, already given several excellent coloured sketches of
natives affected with tubercular leprosy. The disease, according
to various authors, still prevails in the northern kingdoms of
Norway and Sweden. I am not by any means sufficiently intimate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>with the literature of the Scandinavian radesyge, to venture to
offer any decided opinion with regard to its nosological nature,
and its alleged relation to the leprosy of the middle ages. As far,
however, as I am acquainted with the subject, it appears to me
that under the name of radesyge, two, if not more distinct species
of disease were, by Holst and the other authors who first wrote
upon it, confounded and described together. One of these, the
radesyge properly so called, is probably nearly allied to, if not
identical with the sibbens of Scotland. Another of the supposed
varieties of the disease, the spedalskhed or spet&auml;lska, seems on the
other hand to be a different nosological species, hereditary, non-contagious,
chronic, incurable, and identical in many, if not in all
its characters, with true tubercular leprosy. The spet&auml;lska seems
confined to particular and more limited localities in the north than
the radesyge; and when we look to the descriptions of it as seen
at Ostrobothnia by Udmann,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> or as given by H&uuml;nefeld,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> in regard
to the disease at Bergen, we certainly find these descriptions very
exactly answering to the definitions of tubercular or Arabian
leprosy given by our best nosologists and pathologists, and which
I shall have occasion afterwards to discuss at some length. Besides,
radesyge is a disease which is believed by many to have made its
first appearance in Sweden and Norway during the last century,
while the spet&auml;lska was known at a greatly earlier date. The present
hospital for it at Bergen was, as H&uuml;nefeld<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> informs us, founded
as early as the year 1268.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p><p>In the Second Part I will take an opportunity of considering at
length the nosological nature of the leprosy of the middle ages,
particularly as it was seen prevailing in Great Britain. I will
inquire into the rank, age, etc., of those attacked, and point out
some of the causes which have been considered as connected with
the dissemination of the disease; and lastly, I will endeavour to
bring together some of the strange regulations of medical police
that were adopted in England and Scotland with regard to the
infected.</p>

<hr />
<h3>PART II.</h3>

<p class="center2">THE NOSOLOGICAL NATURE OF THE DISEASE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the preceding Part we have shown the extent to which leprosy
prevailed during the middle ages in Great Britain; the number of
hospitals that were instituted for the reception and seclusion of the
infected; the government and regulations of these hospitals; and
the dates of the commencement and disappearance of the disease in
the kingdoms of England and Scotland. Before proceeding farther,
we propose,&mdash;in this Second Part,&mdash;to pause and discuss the strictly
medical question of the specific nosological nature of the malady,
whose history we have thus far considered.</p>

<p class="tb">I have already taken occasion to speak of the leprosy of the
middle ages, as identical with the species of cutaneous disorder,
which has been variously denominated the tubercular leprosy,
(<i>Lepra tuberculosa</i>); the leprosy of the Arabians (<i>Lepra Arabum</i>);
and the elephantiasis of the Greeks (<i>Elephantiasis Gr&aelig;corum</i>).
The particular form of chronic cutaneous disease, to which these
different appellations have been severally applied, is an affection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
very distinctly marked in its more leading symptoms and course.
Before, however, attempting to prove that the European and British
leprosy of former times was specifically identical with the malady in
question, it will expedite our investigation of the question if, in
the first instance, we obtain a precise and perfect picture of the
tubercular or Arabian leprosy itself. By adopting this plan, we
shall have placed before us a standard, as it were, by which we
can judge of and test those more or less imperfect descriptions of
the leprosy of the middle ages, which we may in the sequel have
occasion to quote and animadvert upon. And in order to obtain
such a standard of comparison as we have now in view, and that
without any possibility of prejudging the subject, I shall cite
the description of this species of disease from Dr. Bateman of
London, and Dr. Schedel of Paris;&mdash;from the first, because the
characters which he has given of this and other cutaneous affections
are generally and justly looked upon by British pathologists as
the most clear and distinct that can anywhere be referred to;&mdash;and
from the last, because his account of tubercular leprosy is, I
believe, the latest that has issued from the medical press, and the
author has already, by a former work,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> distinguished himself by the
excellence of his descriptions, and the precision of his diagnosis of
cutaneous diseases.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Modern Descriptions and Definitions of Tubercular Leprosy.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The elephantiasis,&#8221; says Dr. Bateman<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> &#8220;(as described by the
Greeks), is principally characterised by the appearance of shining
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>tubercles, of different sizes, of a dusky red or livid colour, on the
face, ears, and extremities; together with a thickened and rugose
state of the skin, a diminution or total loss of its sensibility, and a
falling off of all the hair, except that of the scalp.</p>

<p>&#8220;The disease is described as very slow in its progress, sometimes
continuing for several years, without materially deranging the
functions of the patient. During this continuance, however, great
deformity is gradually produced. The al&aelig; of the nose become
swelled and scabrous, and the nostrils dilate; the lips are tumid;
the external ears, particularly the lobes, are enlarged and thickened,
and beset with tubercles; the skin of the forehead and cheeks grows
thick and tumid, and forms large and prominent rug&aelig;, especially
over the eyes; the hair of the eyebrows, the beard, the pubes,
axill&aelig;, etc., falls off; the voice becomes hoarse and obscure; and
the sensibility of the parts affected is obtuse, or totally abolished,
so that pinching or puncturing them gives no uneasiness. This
disfiguration of the countenance suggested the idea of the features
of a satyr or a wild beast; whence the disease was by some called
<i>Satyriasis</i>, and by others <i>Leontiasis</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;As the malady proceeds, the tubercles begin to crack, and at
length to ulcerate: Ulcerations also appear in the throat, and in
the nose, which sometimes destroy the palate, and the cartilaginous
septum; the nose falls, and the breath is intolerably offensive.
The thickened and tuberculated skin of the extremities becomes
divided by fissures, and ulcerates, or is corroded under dry sordid
scabs, so that the fingers and toes gangrene, and separate, joint after
joint.&#8221;</p>

<p>The description of the course and symptoms of the disease, as
given by Schedel, is more minute and detailed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Lepra tuberculosa</i>, or Greek elephantiasis, is&#8221; (he observes),<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>
&#8220;characterised by the eruption of fawn-coloured or yellowish-brown
tubercles, various in size, irregular in shape, somewhat shining, and
soft and smooth to the touch. These tubercles are preceded by
erythematous patches, in which the sensibility of the skin is diminished:
slightly elevated at their outset, they become afterwards
more projecting, whilst the sensibility of the parts is usually quite
lost, although they are sometimes painful when touched. They
more frequently occur upon the face, the nose, the ears, the lips,
etc.; and being accompanied with a thickened and rugose state of
the skin, they cause a most hideous distortion of the features, and
frightful deformity.</p>

<p>&#8220;The evolution of the leprous tubercles is usually preceded by
that of slight erythematous patches of a tawny red hue in whites,
and blacker than the surrounding integuments in negroes. These
patches are worthy of attention, since they announce the dreadful
disease which is about to appear. When they are of some duration,
the skin in these points already begins to lose its sensibility.
Sooner or later, in some cases quickly in others very slowly, small
soft, livid red tumours appear, varying in size from that of a pea
to that of a walnut, or even larger. When these tubercles come
out, the erythematous patches, on which the sensibility of the integument
had become lessened, sometimes become painful; so
much so, that we have heard patients declare that the pain produced
by the handling of the small tumours at this period was similar to
that felt when the cubital nerve receives a blow at the elbow.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
When they appear on the face, they are generally accompanied by
a puffy swelling of the surrounding parts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes only small surfaces are attacked. We have seen
the nose and ears alone affected, and much swollen and enlarged.
When the disease occurs on the lower extremities only, it is found
on the inferior part of the thigh, and around the ankles.</p>

<p>&#8220;After remaining stationary for a longer or shorter time, the
disorder increases: instead of a few tubercles to be met with here
and there, the whole face is covered with large dusky red lumps,
separated by deep furrows; the features are horribly distorted;
the al&aelig; of the nose are thickened and swollen; the nostrils dilated;
the eyebrows tuberculated and overhanging; the lips enormously
thickened; the skin of the forehead and cheeks is thick, uneven,
and tumid; the chin much increased in size, and the whole of the
affected surfaces appear as if smeared with oil, and of a dusky livid
red; the external ears, especially the lobes, are much enlarged and
thickened, and beset with tubercles; the eyebrows and eyelashes
and beard fall off; the sense of smell becomes impaired or totally
lost; that of touch is often strangely affected; the voice grows
husky, and is frequently lost; the eyesight is greatly weakened;
the unfortunate patient is dejected; and the muscular powers
depressed in a singular manner. With regard to the <i>libido inexplicabilis</i>,
so much spoken of, our observations do not coincide with
those of Dr. Adams, who mentions actual wasting of the generative
organs. In the cases which have come under our notice we have
witnessed quite the reverse, and yet several were young men in
whom the disease was not too far advanced.</p>

<p>&#8220;At a still later period the symptoms are even more dreadful;
the tubercles become the seat of ulceration, and sores of an un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>healthy
character succeed, and discharge an ichorous fluid, which,
on concreting, form dark adherent scabs of various extent and
thickness; these incrustations are sometimes followed by cicatrices,
but this is unfortunately a rare occurrence. On the extremities
the thick and tuberculated skin becomes divided by fissures, and
ulcerates or is corroded under the dry scabs, so that the fingers
and toes mortify and separate, joint after joint, the miserable patient
surviving these horrid mutilations. Those individuals whom we
have seen perish from this disease were carried off by enteritis;
large ulcerations were found in the ilium, c&aelig;cum, and colon,
excepting in one case, in which death was caused by tubercular
phthisis.&#8221;</p>

<p>In studying the phenomena of this, as of any other disease, it
will simplify our recollection of its more leading and more constant
characters, if we have the principal symptoms of it embodied in a
concise nosological definition, instead of being spread through a long
and detailed description. Two of our last and best British nosologists
give the following definition of tubercular leprosy or Greek
elephantiasis (for I use these terms here and elsewhere as words
perfectly synonymous).</p>

<p>&#8220;Elephantiasis&#8221; (says Dr. Cullen), &#8220;is a contagious disease,
with (1) the face deformed with tubercles; (2) the skin thick,
wrinkled, rough, unctuous, and divested of hair; (3) loss of feeling
in the extreme joints; and (4) the voice is hoarse and nasal.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<p class="tb">In defining the genus elephantiasis, Dr. Good selects the second
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>and third characters of Cullen as the most distinctive, and adds to
these two others&mdash;viz. &#8220;(1) eyes fierce and staring; (2) perspiration
highly offensive.&#8221; In defining the first species of this genus (or
the Greek elephantiasis of other authors), he introduces as its three
pathognomonic symptoms, the first and fourth characters of Cullen
and a part of the second.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Nomenclature of the Disease.</span></p>

<p>Leprosy, such as it is portrayed in the descriptions and definitions
which we have quoted from Bateman, Schedel, Cullen, and
Good (and I might have cited any of our modern medical writers
to the same effect), has had at different times, and by different
authors, a great variety of appellations applied to it. In order to
understand the nosological nature of the disease, as it formerly
prevailed in Europe, it is requisite to state a few uninteresting
but indispensable facts, in regard to the changes which have
occurred in its nomenclature.</p>

<p>In the medical writings of Aret&aelig;us, Aetius, and the later school
of Greek physicians, the disease is described under the title of
elephantiasis, for (says Aret&aelig;us) &#8220;it is disgusting to the sight, and
terrible in all respects (<i>est visu f&oelig;dus et in omnibus terribilis</i>), like
the beast of the same name.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> The Arabian medical authors
applied the corresponding term of &#8220;<i>Das Fil</i>,&#8221; &#8220;elephant disease,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>or elephantiasis, to an affection entirely different, and one apparently
unknown to the Greek physicians, namely, the tumid, Barbadoes,
or Cochin leg of modern pathologists. At the same time the
Arabian authorities described the disease, known to the Greeks
under the name of elephantiasis, by the Arabic terms &#8220;<i>Judam</i>,&#8221;
or &#8220;<i>Juzam</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>Aljuzam</i>.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> The confusion thus apt to arise
from describing two different diseases under a corresponding name
was greatly increased by the errors committed by the Latin translators
of Avicenna, Rhazes, and other Arabic authors. These
translators rendered the <i>Das fil</i> or Elephant disease of the Arabic
original, by the words elephanta and elephantiasis; and having
thus, first, by an improper adaptation, appropriated the use of the
latter Greek term to a disease very different in its specific characters
from the elephantiasis of the Greeks themselves, they subsequently
added to the intricacies of the subject by translating the Arabic
&#8220;Juzam&#8221; (the disease that was in reality identical with the elephantiasis
of the Greeks) by the term lepra&mdash;a term which the Greek
physicians had generally applied to different forms of scaly eruption,
but never to any form of tubercular disease.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p><p>By these unfortunate mistakes medical men were betrayed into
great confusion in the use of these several terms. An identity in
names did not signify an identity in objects. The tumid leg, <i>das fil</i>,
or elephantiasis of the Arabians, is a disease perfectly different from
the tuberculous face affection or elephantiasis of the Greeks.</p>

<p class="tb">Again, the term lepra, as used by the Greek physicians themselves,
signifies morbid changes in the skin, marked by the presence
of scales, and which changes in the skin have no relation whatever
to either the Arabian or Greek elephantiasis; but the same term
lepra, as used by the Arabic translators, was applied to designate
the latter of these two affections, viz. the Arabic &#8220;Juzam,&#8221; or
elephantiasis of the Greeks. Hence, the <i>elephantiasis of the Greeks</i>
and the <i>lepra of the Arabians</i>, or more properly of the Arabian
translators, are expressions altogether synonymous, as being employed
to designate the same individual disease; and it is of the first
importance to hold this fact in view in studying the histories of
the European leprosy, which have been left us by our own and by
other medical authors of the middle ages.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> For we must further
recollect that the knowledge of the Greek tongue was almost
entirely lost during the dark ages, and that nearly all learning
being then confined to the Moors and Arabs, the scholastic language
was principally the Arabic. Thus it happened, that when the love
of literature and the pursuit of science began to revive about the
twelfth century, the medical as well as the philosophical writings
of the ancient Greeks were read and studied by the inhabitants of
Western Europe through the medium of Arabic translations of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>them, or in Latin versions made from these translations.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> The
designations of individual diseases were known to the learned
student, and to the medical practitioner and author of the times in
question, by the names only under which they were described in
these versions. The <i>elephantiasis</i> of the Greeks, or corresponding
<i>juzam</i> of the Arabians, was rendered by the term <i>lepra</i> in almost
every Latin translation from the Arabian or Saracenic school; and
hence it is that we find this term lepra used by the medical and
other authors of the succeeding period, as the common appellative for
the individual disease to which the two former designations were
originally applied. In many medical works of the middle ages
the single name &#8220;<i>lepra</i>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> is employed; in the writings of others,
and more particularly of later authors, it has the distinctive designation
(<i>Lepra Arabum</i>) added to it,<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> in order to discriminate it
from the <i>Lepra Gr&aelig;corum</i> or scaly eruptions, to which that term was
primarily applied by the Greeks. In still more modern times, and
with the same view, the <i>Elephantiasis Gr&aelig;corum</i>, Juzam, or Lepra of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>the Arabians, or rather of the Arabian translators, has been very frequently
termed (as I believe was first proposed by Vidal)<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> tuberculous
leprosy (<i>Lepra tuberculosa</i>), in order to distinguish it from
the other very different disease, the scaly leprosy of the Greeks
(<i>Lepra vulgaris</i>, <i>Lepra squamosa</i>, etc.) But, whatever may be the
difference in the nomenclature of different authors, we are to hold
this in recollection, that the various terms of the elephantiasis of
the Greeks (<i>Elephantiasis Gr&aelig;corum</i>), the juzam or leprosy of the
Arabian translators (<i>Lepra Arabum</i>), the tuberculous leprosy of
modern European authors (<i>Lepra tuberculosa</i>, <i>Lepra nodosa</i>), and the
simple leprosy (<i>Lepra</i>) of most authors of the middle ages,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>&mdash;all
signify that same specific and individual disease, whose distinctive
characters we have already traced from Bateman and Schedel, and
from Cullen and Good.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Specific Character of the Leprosy which prevailed during
the Middle Ages.</span></p>

<p>Having premised the preceding tedious but necessary digression
upon the nomenclature of leprosy, we now proceed to consider the
question whether the particular form of disease that prevailed on
the Continent and in Great Britain during the middle ages, and for
the victims of which so many hospitals were built, and so many
laws enacted, answered or not, in its nosological characters, to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span><i>Elephantiasis Gr&aelig;corum, Lepra Arabum</i> or Arabian leprosy, such
as we have found that malady depicted in the standards already
referred to, and such as it is known to prevail at the present day
in different localities in the new and old world, that I shall afterwards
take occasion to specify. We begin our inquiry into the
nature of the disease, by considering the characters of the leprosy
as it was seen prevailing, almost epidemically, in the middle ages.</p>

<p>1. <i>Upon the Continent of Europe.</i>&mdash;To obtain a solution of this
part of our problem, let us turn to the works of the medical authors
of these early times, and endeavour to ascertain from them the
nature of the disease which they denominated leprosy.</p>

<p>Various minute descriptions of leprosy (lepra) have been left
us in the writings of different European physicians and surgeons
of the middle ages, who had an opportunity of studying the disease
in different kingdoms upon the Continent during the period of its
actual prevalence. Amongst others we may especially refer to the
accounts of it, written during the thirteenth century, by the monk
Theodoric,<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> afterwards a distinguished surgeon of Bologna; by the
celebrated Lanfranc, who was first a practitioner in Milan,<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> and
subsequently in Paris; and by Professor Arnold Bachuone,<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> of
Barcelona, reputed in his day the greatest physician in Spain.
Valescus de Taranta,<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> a physician of Montpellier; Bernhard Gor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>don,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a>
Professor of Medicine in the same city; the famous French
Surgeon, Guy de Chauliac;<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a>&mdash;Vitalis de Furno,<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> Cardinal of Albany;
and Petrus de Argelata,<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> a practitioner of Bologna, have each left us
descriptions of leprosy drawn up during the fourteenth century; and
during the two succeeding centuries, we have more or less accurate
accounts of the disease given by Professors Montagnana<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> of Padua
and Matthew Ferrari de Gradi<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> of Pavia, by Ambrose Par&eacute;,<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>
Joannes Fernelius,<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> Palmarius,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> Hildanus<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> and various others.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>Each of the several authors just now named has described,
with greater or less precision, the symptoms of the prevailing
leprosy, or chronic incurable cutaneous disease, for the reception
and seclusion of the victims of which the numerous lazar-houses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>in Europe were established. The details which they all individually
give of the leading characters of the malady<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> are in their essential
points altogether similar; and the symptoms which they describe
it as presenting are exactly those which distinguish Greek elephantiasis.
The disease is portrayed with brevity and precision by
some of them. Others enter into a detail of its phenomena, greatly
more minute than the descriptions I have quoted from Bateman
and Schedel; and several give a history of the marks to be derived
from the blood, urine, extremities, eyes, face, voice, etc., in a manner
so very elaborate and minute, as might surprise us at the present
day, did we not recollect the immense importance that depended in
these times upon a just and faithful distinction of the disease, when,
in a suspected case, a fellow-being might,&mdash;by the absence of the
more characteristic signs&mdash;be saved, or&mdash;by their presence&mdash;be
condemned, for the remainder of life, to all the horrors of a lazar-house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
A few, as Guy de Chauliac, Argelata, etc., in the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries, and in still later times, Gregory Horst,
Forrestus, etc., add a most minute and detailed account of the
various symptoms which the physician ought to look for in examining
a suspected person, and point out the exact mode in which he
ought to proceed with this examination before venturing to consign
a suspected person to the seclusion of a leper hospital, and thus for
ever doom him to be a despised &#8220;child of St.&nbsp;Lazarus.&#8221;</p>

<p>In an essay such as the present, it would be out of place to
attempt to show, by the exact words of each of the authors to whom
I have just now alluded, the truth of the proposition that the lepra
in their writings, and consequently the lepra of Europe in their
times, was strictly identical with the elephantiasis of the Greeks,
and that the leper hospitals were specially intended for those
affected with this disease. As examples, however, of the whole, I
may cite the observations of two of the authors whom I have
named; and I shall select for this purpose Gordon and Guy de
Chauliac, principally from their two names standing higher in
medical history than most of the others that I have enumerated&mdash;from
their living at a time when the disease was most prevalent,&mdash;and
from their descriptions of the malady itself being on the whole
more than usually concise and methodic.</p>

<p>Bernhard Gordon was, at the commencement of the fourteenth
century, one of the first, if not the first Professor of Medicine in
the newly-established school of Montpellier. &#8220;He has left us,&#8221;
says Dr. Freind,<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> &#8220;a large volume called <i>Lilium Medicinae</i>(for in
that affected age everything writ in Physick, was either a Lily or a
Rose), a book mightily celebrated in those times.&#8221; This volume
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>is generally stated to have been written about the year 1305<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> or
1309.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> From the very long chapter which is devoted in this work
to the consideration of leprosy, I shall translate the account which
the author gives of his threefold stages or classes of symptoms of the
disease&mdash;viz. the occult, the infallible, and the last or terminating
signs.</p>

<p>1. &#8220;The occult premonitory signs (<i>signa occulta in principio</i>)
of leprosy are (he states) a reddish colour of the face, verging to
duskiness; the expiration begins to be changed; the voice grows
raucous, the hairs become thinned and weaker, and the perspiration
and breath incline to f&oelig;tidity; the mind is melancholic with frightful
dreams and nightmare; in some cases scabs, pustules, and eruptions,
break out over the whole body; the disposition of the body
begins to become loathsome, but still, while the form and figure
(<i>forma et figura</i>) are not corrupted, the patient is not to be adjudged
for separation, but is to be most strictly watched (<i>nondum est judicandus
ad separationem, sed est fortissime comminandus</i>.)</p>

<p>2. &#8220;The infallible signs (<i>signa infallibilia</i>) are enlargement of
the eyebrows, with loss of their hair; rotundity of the eyes;
swelling of the nostrils externally, and contraction of them within;
voice nasal; colour of the face glossy (<i>lucidus</i>), verging to a darkish
hue; aspect of the face terrible, with a fixed look, and with acumination
and contraction of the pulps of the ears. And there are
many other signs, as pustules and excrescences, atrophy of the
muscles, and particularly of those between the thumb and forefinger;
insensibility of the extremities; fissures and infections of
the skin; the blood, when drawn and washed, containing black,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>earthy, rough, sandy matters, and other marks which authors prominently
mention, but for me, those suffice which are to be found
in the face. The above are those evident and manifest signs, which,
when they do appear, the patient ought to be separated from the
people (<i>quibus apparentibus patiens est a populo sequestrandus</i>), or, in
other words, secluded in a leper-house.</p>

<p>3. &#8220;The signs of the last stage, and breaking-up (<i>naufragium</i>)
of the disease are, corrosion and falling-in of the cartilage forming
the septum of the nose; fissure and division (<i>scissura</i>) of the feet
and hands; enlargement of the lips, and a disposition to glandular
swelling; dyspn&oelig;a and difficulty of breathing; the voice hoarse
and barking; the aspect of the face frightful, and of a dark colour;
and the pulse small and imperceptible.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>After giving the above accurate description of the leprosy, Gordon,
in a subsequent page,<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> earnestly states, &#8220;No one ought to be
adjudged as a leper unless there manifestly appear a corruption of
the figure (<i>corruptio figurae</i>), or that state which is indicated by his
<i>signa infallibilia</i>. And I repeat to you this (he adds), as often as
I have occasion to mention the <i>corruptio figurae</i>, because, as it
appears to me, lepers are at the present day very injudiciously
adjudged. Whoever, therefore, has ears, let him attend to this, if
he will.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other medical author whom I particularised for quotation,
Guy de Chauliac, practised first at Lyons, and afterwards at Avignon.
He was one of the most celebrated surgeons in the fourteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>
and was successively medical attendant upon Popes Clement
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>VI. and Urban V.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> From the notice which he gives of the Black
Death Pestilence of 1363, it would seem that he was then stationed
at Avignon, and engaged in the Composition of his &#8221;Inventarium
sive Collectorium Partis Chirurgicalis Medicinae.&#8221; In the long
disquisition on lepra, contained in the 6th treatise of this work,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a>
De Chauliac, after stating the usual subdivision of the disease into
four varieties or species (Elephantia, Leonina, Tyria, Alopecia),
goes on to describe the common signs of all the varieties of leprosy,
(signa communia <i>Omnium</i> specierum Lepr&aelig;). The signs or symptoms
indicating the actual presence of the disease are, he says, some
unequivocal, others equivocal (<i>qu&aelig;dam univoca, qu&aelig;dam equivoca</i>).
Among the former set (<i>signa univoca</i>) he ranges the six following
symptoms:&mdash;&#8220;(1.) rotundity of the ears and eyes; (2.) thickening
and tuberosity of the eyebrows, with falling off of their hair; (3.)
dilatation and disfiguration of the nostrils externally, with stricture
of them within, and f&oelig;tidity of the lips; (4.) voice raucous and
nasal; (5.) f&oelig;tidity of the breath, and of the whole person; (6.)
fixed and horrible satyr-like aspect.&#8221;</p>

<p>I question if any of our modern nosologists, or any recent
writers on cutaneous diseases, have proposed a more correct definition,
or accurate and concise diagnosis of the <i>Elephantiasis
Gr&aelig;corum</i> than is presented in the above enumeration of its
pathognomonic symptoms by the old French surgeon.</p>

<p>De Chauliac adds a list of sixteen signs of leprosy, which, from
their not being constant, he terms equivocal (<i>equivoca</i>). Among
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>these he gives tuberosity and hardness of the flesh, particularly of
the joints and extremities; insensibility and feeling of torpor in
the limbs; falling off of the hairs; tubercles (<i>grana</i>) under the
tongue and palpebr&aelig;, and behind the ears; an unctuous condition
of the skin, as seen when water is thrown upon it; with symptoms
from the blood, urine, etc. &#8220;By these unequivocal and equivocal
signs, lepers (says he) are examined; but (he judiciously goes on
to observe), in the examination and judgment of lepers there
must be much circumspection, because the injury is very great,
whether we thus submit to confinement those that ought not to be
confined, or allow lepers (<i>leprosos</i>) to mix with the people, seeing
the disease is contagious and infectious. Therefore ought the
physician repeatedly to examine the affected, and consider and
re-consider those signs which are unequivocal, and those that are
equivocal, and let him not venture to judge by one sign, but by a
concourse of many, and particularly of those that are unequivocal.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Chauliac subsequently details at great length the precise
mode in which the physician ought to conduct the examination of
every suspected case of leprosy referred to him. The patient is,
first of all, as we shall afterwards see, recommended to be consoled
upon his unfortunate lot, and sworn in to tell the truth in
answer to all the interrogatories put to him. In immediately
afterwards proceeding to the examination itself, De Chauliac orders
inquiries to be instituted into the predisposition, hereditary or otherwise,
of the suspected individual; if he were exposed by intercourse
with the infected; if his mind were clear and tranquil; if he
feels punctures in the flesh, etc. He then recommends the pulse
to be examined, and some blood drawn, and treated in such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
manner by inspection and straining, as to ascertain its colour, its
sediment, the quality of its coagulum, etc. After this he recommends
the countenance to be considered, and the patient dismissed
for the day, with an order to bring a specimen of his urine with
him on the following morning. &#8220;In the meantime,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;let
the physician cogitate upon what he has seen, and what he may
yet see in the case.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the morrow, when the suspected person returns to the
physician, let the latter, in the first place, examine the urine, and
consider if it shows any sign of disposition towards leprosy. All
this being done, let him next again consider the face, and ascertain
in regard to the eyebrows if they have lost their hair, and if they
are swollen and tuberose; if the eyes themselves are round, particularly
towards the internal angles, and if the whites of them
are of a darkish hue; in regard to the nose, if it be deformed,
enlarged, and internally ulcerated; in regard to the eyes, if they are
rounded and shortened; in regard to the voice, if it is raucous
and nasal; in regard to the lips and tongue, if they are ulcerated
and tuberculated; if the breathing be difficult and f&oelig;tid; and if
the features be changed and frightful. And let the examiner consider
these things deeply, because the signs from the face are more
certain than the others. Afterwards make the person strip himself
naked (<i>ipsum expoliare</i>), and examine concerning the colour
of the whole body, if it is darkish and morphous; concerning the
substance of the flesh, if it is hard and irregular, and tuberose, particularly
about the joints and extremities; if it is scabrous, pruriginous,
or serpiginous and ulcerous; if its corion is rough, like
the skin of the goose; and if the muscles are consumed; if there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
is a feeling of sleeping in the limbs; if he feels perfectly when
pricked along the back of the leg, and is certain in respect to the spot
and kind of instrument. Then pour water upon his body, and see
if it is unctuous, and if salt adheres to it when it is thrown upon its
surface. Lastly, let the physician return again to the consideration
of the face and countenance, and with that dismiss the person.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let all the ascertained signs (cautiously, adds our author) be
pondered over, and let the physician deliberate naturally concerning
these signs, both individually and in concourse. If he should
find that the suspected person has, along with a disposition to
leprosy, some of the slighter equivocal signs of the disease, the
individual is to be watched at his own house, and secretly, that he
may be placed upon a good regimen, and have the advice of medical
men, otherwise he will truly become leprous. If, however, he
presents many equivocal with a few of the unequivocal signs, he
is vulgarly termed <i>cassatus</i> (marked, denounced); and such individuals
must be narrowly watched, in order that they take a proper
regimen, and have the good advice of physicians; and in order
that they confine themselves within their own houses and mansions.
Let them not freely mix with the people, because they are sinking
into leprosy. If, again, they are found with many, both of the
unequivocal and equivocal signs, they must be separated with kind
and consoling words from the people, and committed to the leper
hospitals (<i>in Malanteria ducendi</i>). But if they are sound they
must be set free (<i>absolvendi</i>), and sent with a medical certificate to
the Rector.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">It would, I believe, be considered altogether a work of super<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>erogation
to append to the preceding details by Gordon and Guy
de Chauliac any formal remarks in the way of comparing the
<i>Lepra</i> of the fourteenth century with the <i>Elephantiasis Gr&aelig;corum</i>
of Bateman, Schedel, or any of our modern standards, and thus
insisting further upon the perfect and entire identity of the individual
disease passing under these two different designations. The
accounts given of the malady by the two ancient and the two
modern writers just named, undoubtedly agree as exactly as we
ever find the accounts of one and the same disease by four different
authors do; and, as I have already said, the same remark might
be extended to the relative early descriptions of the lepra, as left
by numerous other authors in these times, and the recent descriptions
of the <i>Elephantiasis Gr&aelig;corum</i>, as drawn up from personal
observation in different parts of the world by Kinnis, Ainslie,
Heineken, Casan, Cazenave, and the other modern writers that I
shall afterwards have occasion to refer to when speaking of the
present geographical <i>habitats</i> of the disease.</p>

<p>But indeed the intrinsic evidence which is afforded by the extracts
that I have given from Gordon and De Chauliac, and by
the other similar descriptions to which I have referred in the works
of the medical authors of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
renders it unnecessary to add here any further comment to prove
the double proposition, <i>first</i>, that the leprosy of the middle ages,
as the disease prevailed upon the continent of Europe, was identical
with the <i>Elephantiasis Gr&aelig;corum</i>; and, <i>secondly</i>, that it was
for the victims of this specific malady that the numerous leper
hospitals were established, they alone being the individuals who
were intended to be (in the language of Gordon and De Chauliac)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
adjudged, separated from the people, and consigned to the lazar-houses
(&#8221;<i>judicati</i>&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;<i>a populo sequestrandi</i>&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;<i>in Malanteria
ducendi</i>&#8221;).</p>

<p>So far with regard to leprosy, as seen and described by the early
continental authors. Let us now return to the nature of the disease
as it prevailed in Great Britain.</p>

<p>2. <i>Nature of the Leprosy in England.</i>&mdash;Reasoning analogically,
it may certainly, with the greatest probability, be presumed that
the incurable disease which is known in the lazar-house charters
and older histories of this country, under the same name as on the
continent,&mdash;which prevailed here during the same periods as on
the continent,&mdash;and for which the same systems of medical seclusion
and police were adopted,&mdash;was entirely the same disease as that
described by and known to the continental medical authors of the
middle ages.</p>

<p>To some minds, such considerations may in themselves be
sufficient to fix the identity of the disease, as it prevailed on the
continent, and as it prevailed in our own country; and certainly
they tend very strongly to show that if, as I have attempted to prove,
the epidemic leprosy of continental Europe was the tubercular or
Arabian leprosy, the leprosy of England and Scotland was of the
same specific nature. But I believe I can adduce still more direct
and satisfactory evidence to establish this important point.</p>

<p>The first valuable medical work by an English author that has
been transmitted to us is the <i>Compendium Medicinae</i> of Gilbert.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>
<p>This author is generally supposed to have lived about 1270, in the
reign of Henry III. or Edward I.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> Bale places him even much
earlier.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p>Gilbert has a chapter headed &#8220;De Lepra.&#8221; In this chapter
he describes very minutely the four usual modifications of lepra
(the Elephantia, Leonina, Tyria, and Alopecia), varieties which, he
himself observes, are rarely found pure and simple, but generally
mixed together (<i>compositas</i>).<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> To quote in proof of this his long
and very detailed account of the disease would occupy much space
and only lead to repetition. That the description, however, which
Gilbert has drawn of the leprosy of the middle ages is one of the
most just and accurate penned during these times, has been often
and freely admitted by Sauvages, Sprengel, and other competent
judges. Further, that the lepra as described by Gilbert, and as
understood by him and his contemporaries in England, meant the
elephantiasis of the Greeks, is evident (without going into particulars)
from the simple fact, that the sagacious Sauvages refers
to and quotes this chapter of Gilbert&#8217;s on lepra as one of the best
descriptions extant of Greek elephantiasis.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p>In an official report given in to the Royal Society of Medicine
of Paris in 1782, upon the Greek elephantiasis, the reporters, MM.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>Chamseru and Coquereau, specially allude to Gilbert&#8217;s description
as the most clear exposition of it to which they could refer.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a>
Again, in an analysis of the works of this early English author,
the learned Professor Sprengel observes, &#8220;Gilbert sometimes relates,
though very rarely, observations which are proper to himself, and
which deserve to be quoted. In this number I include particularly
those concerning leprosy. We may almost look upon them as the
first exact description which has been given of that malady by the
Christian physicians of the west. The spots which foretell it, and
the signs of its first invasion, are at least described by him in a
manner agreeable to nature,&#8221; etc.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></p>

<p>Here, then, we have the direct and positive evidence of an English
physician of the thirteenth century, that the term lepra was then
used in this country specially to designate the varieties of Greek
elephantiasis; and I might adduce (if it were at all necessary), to
demonstrate exactly the same circumstance, the chapter which
John of Gaddesden, Professor of Medicine in Merton College,
Oxford,<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> and Court physician to Edward II., has devoted to lepra
or elephantiasis in his famous <i>Rosa Anglica</i>, a work written
towards the commencement of the succeeding or fourteenth cen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>tury.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a>
In this &#8220;Opus luculentum et eruditum&#8221; (as at least Leland
terms it),<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> the author describes at considerable length the nature,
causes, and premonitory signs, etc., of lepra and its varieties, and
enters minutely into the pathognomonic signs (signa demonstrativa
infallibilia) of the disease, as respectively taken from the face,
from the extremities, from the blood, and from the humours of the
body. A quotation from his signs of leprosy, as taken from the
face, will at once show that by that term (lepra) he meant the
Greek elephantiasis. I shall give the passage in his own words.
&#8220;A <i>Facie</i>, rotundatio oculorum, contractio palpebrarum, lacrimositas
multa et aquositas oculorum, depiliatio superciliorum et grossities
eorum; dilatatio narium exterius et constrictio interius, et coartatio
anhelitus, quasi si cum naribus loqueretur. Et color faciei lividus
vergens ad fuscedinem mortificatam. Terribilis aspectus faciei cum
fixo intuitu. Contractio et palpebrarum et aurium. Infectio cutis
maculosa. Tuberositas et pustulae in facie et nodositas. Ista
omnia et major pars sunt infallibilia signa lepr&aelig; actualis.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> In a
subsequent part of his chapter on Lepra, John of Gaddesden
strongly states, that &#8220;no one is to be adjudged a leper, and separated
from intercourse of mankind (<i>ab hominum conversatione
separandus</i>), until the figure and form of the face is actually changed.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Hence cancer (gangrene?) in the feet, or foul scabbing, must not
be considered as arguing the presence of leprosy, nor nodosities,
unless they appear on the face and with the aforesaid conditions.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></p>

<p>The testimony of Bartholomey Glanville, an English author of
the latter part of the fourteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> may be adduced in support
of the same view. In his work &#8220;De Proprietatibus Rerum&#8221;
he describes persons affected with leprosy (lepra) as having &#8220;redde
Whelkes and Pymples in the Face, out of whome oftenne runne
Blood and Matter: in such the Noses swellen, and ben (become)
grete, the vertue of Smellynge faylyth, and the Brethe stynkyth
ryght fowle.&#8221; When, he further observes, the disease is so advanced
that the infected are &#8220;unclene, spotyd, glemy, and quyttery
(ichorous), the Nosethrilles ben stopyl, the Wasen of the Voys is
rough, and the Voys is horse, and the Heere [hair] falls.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></p>

<p class="tb">In addition to the preceding direct medical evidence, it may
not be considered irrelevant to the present question to remark
that, in most of the lazar-house charters and notices in England
and Scotland that I have had access to, the inmates of these institutions
are described by the adjective <i>leprosus</i>, or by some application
of the corresponding noun <i>lepra</i>, as &#8220;lepra percussi,&#8221; &#8220;infecti
lepra.&#8221; I have, however, met with one very striking exception to
this general rule, and I allude to it here as confirmatory of what I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>have stated with regard to the nature of the disease for which
these leper hospitals were instituted in our own country. The
leper hospital of Sherburne was, as I have already had occasion to
mention, endowed for sixty patients, and was hence one of the
largest in England. It was founded in 1181 by Hugh Pudsey,
&#8220;the jollie Bishope of Durham.&#8221; In a MS. History of the Durham
Cathedral and Diocese, in the Bodleian Library,<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> the inmates of the
Sherburne Hospital, instead of being termed <i>Leprosi</i>, are directly
designated <i>Elephantuosi</i>. In speaking of the acts of Bishop
Pudsey, the MS. states, amongst other things, that he constructed
the hospital of Sherburne, and planted in it lepers collected from all
parts of the bishoprick. (<i>Elefantuosos</i>, in Episcopatu suo circumquaque
collectos, ibidem instituit.)</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Nature of the Leprosy of Scotland.</span></p>

<p>I have hitherto said nothing to show that the disease in Scotland
was of the nature of Greek elephantiasis. During the earlier
ages at which it prevailed in this country, medicine was little cultivated,
and we have no professional work of any kind left us by
the Scottish physicians of that period, from which to derive any
evidence on this subject.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p>Amidst this dearth, however, of medical writings during the
middle ages in Scotland, it gives me pleasure to refer to a passage
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>in one of our earliest Scotch poets, affording proof that the leprosy of
this country was, as on the continent, truly the Greek elephantiasis.</p>

<p>It is well known to the lovers of early Scotch literature that
Henryson, a schoolmaster of Dunfermline, who wrote before the year
1500, composed, among other things, <i>The Testament of Cresseid</i>
as a sequel to the <i>Troilus and Cresseid</i> of his immediate predecessor
Chaucer.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> Indulging, like his English prototype, in the
wildest forms of anachronism, the Scottish poet confessedly subjects,
in almost every particular, the ancient and foreign characters of
the piece to the manners, incidents, and institutions of his own
times, and of his own country. In this spirit he afflicts, at last,
the fickle and unfortunate Cresseid with leprosy, as perhaps the
most appalling of dooms to which he could consign her. The
poet afterwards sends her &#8220;unto yone hospitall at the tounis&#8217; end.&#8221;
The particular symptoms which he makes Saturn invoke upon
Cresseid, to transform her into a leper, are exactly the most marked
symptoms of Greek elephantiasis:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p><p>In this remarkable passage, those more striking symptoms, the
swellings, lumps, or livid tubercles on the face, the morbid alteration
of the voice and skin, and that turgid and injected appearance
of the eye, which Dr. Good has given as one of his characteristic
symptoms of the <i>genus</i> elephantiasis, are all tersely, yet accurately
described. Indeed, if Sauvages, Swediaur, Cullen, or any
of our great nosologists of the last or present century, had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>poets, I greatly doubt whether, with all their medical knowledge
to boot, they could, in four fettered lines of rhyme, have described
the Greek elephantiasis more faithfully and briefly than we have
it described in the four first lines that I have just quoted from the
Dunfermline schoolmaster of the fifteenth century. Henryson&#8217;s
account of a leper may not be so poetically beautiful, but it is
pathologically much more true than that which the American poet,
Willis, has recently given of the disease in his well-known poem
of <i>Helon</i>. We shall afterwards find that &#8220;the cop and clapper,&#8221;
alluded to in Henryson&#8217;s two last lines, were badges commonly
carried by the inmates of the leper hospitals of Scotland.</p>

<p>In passages subsequent to that which I have quoted, Henryson
reiterates some of the more prominent symptoms. Thus, the hapless
Cresseid afterwards describes what is elsewhere termed &#8220;her
uglye lipper face, the whilk before was quhite (white) as lilie
flour,&#8221; as &#8220;deformed in the figour;&#8221; and again also she describes
and laments the characteristic morbid change in the voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i05">&#8220;My cleir voice and my courtlie carrolling.</div>
<div class="line">Is rawk (rank) as roke, full hideous, hoir, and hace.&#8221;.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But I have still further and stronger proof to adduce that the
leprosy of the Scotch was the tubercular lepra or Greek elephantiasis.
It has been already stated that the disease continued to
prevail in the Shetlands, apparently long after it had left all the
more southern parts of the British Islands. We have found
Brand stating in 1700,<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> the disease to be &#8220;discovered (I quote his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>own words) by hairs falling from the eyebrows, the nose falling in,&#8221;
etc. I have shown also that in some districts of Shetland the
disease continued to a later date, and that, down to 1742, the
infected were kept in the island of Papa, or, as it is sometimes
written, Papastour. Through Mr. Charles Duncan, who has kindly
exerted himself in Shetland to procure me information on the present
subject, I have been favoured with the sight of an old but
important document relative to the lepers of Papa, and the symptoms
under which they laboured. The document in question was,
as Mr. Duncan informs me, drawn up for Sir John Pringle, by the
Rev. Andrew Fisken, minister of Delting, Walls, and Sandness.
The old copy I refer to belongs to the Rev. James Barclay (son
of the late Dr. Barclay of Lerwick), and I publish its contents with
his permission. The minute description which it gives of the
symptoms in the lepers of Shetland can leave no doubt as to the
disease under which they suffered being the true tubercular leprosy,
or <i>Elephantiasis Gr&aelig;corum</i>, and the value of the evidence which
it affords on this point is only increased by the fact, that the
writer did not himself belong to the medical profession. The importance
of the document must plead as an excuse for its length.
The copy which is quoted below, is marked on the back, in an old
handwriting, &#8220;Case of the Lepers in Papa, as drawn up by Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Andrew Fisken, about the year 1736 or 1737.&#8221; It proceeds as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are in the Island of Papastour in Zetland five women
who labour under a disease that, generally in this place, gets the
name of Leprosie, though others alledge it deserves rather to be
called a scurvy. The disease has the following appearances, viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The persons affected at first find an unusual itching in their
skin, with small, knotty, hard lumps to be felt under the cuticle;
their whole body appears plumper than ordinary, and their eyes are
observed to be clearer coloured, with a look more piercing than formerly.
Their face and legs are full of small lumps or hard
tumours, which in a little suppurate and throw out a black, thin,
ichorous matter, and gradually encrease, especially in the face, till
they turn confluent. It is also observed that where these lumps
do not appear, the skin feels hard and callous, like a piece of unwrought
leather, and the cuticle smoother than ordinary, and unctuous
or greasy, which appears from pouring water into the palms
of their hands, where it will separate into small globules, such as
appear when water is poured out of a greasy vessel. The extraordinary
plumpness, or rather swelling of the body, observed in the
beginning of this disease, does, in a few months, disappear, and
they turn very lean and weak, only their face always, and sometimes
also their legs, continue swelled. A great many little lumps
like small hard seeds are then to be felt everywhere under their
skin, which gradually increase till they break out externally, throwing
out a f&oelig;tid thin ichor, which ceases to run in a little time,
and a hard scab covers the part, which sometimes dries, and falling
off, leaves the skin entire; at other times breaks out again, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>runs as before. The hair falls off from their eyebrows, and they
have their throats much inflamed, especially the uvula, which is
gradually (and after some years continuing under the disease) entirely
destroyed. Their voice is so weakened that they cannot
speak louder than one whispering. They have frequent flushes of
heat in their skin, which is succeeded by an universal chilliness,
and they are not at that instant able to suffer the cold air without
a very acute soreness in their skin. As the disease encreases, it
appears still the more frightful and loathsome; their face full of
large and deep ulcers, resembles somewhat a lump of rotten cork;
their gums and teeth are quite rotten, and in the night-time they
are much troubled with deep-seated pains in their bodies, and
have in the day-time frequent stitches and pains in all parts of
their body, with a general weight and inactivity of their limbs.
The women also cease to have their menstrua upon their being
seized with this distemper. Their appetite and digestion is as
good as ordinary; their stools regular; nothing extraordinary to be
observed in their urine. They sleep pretty well, but seldom or
never sweat any.</p>

<p>&#8220;This disease is found by experiment to be very infectious, and
seems also to run in blood, most people that have taken it without
infection from another having been related to three families in the
isle. It affects any age or sex, and it is observed that young persons
bear it longer than those of a more advanced age, some having lived
ten years under it, others only two, some four, some six, etc., but
none ever recover after the symptoms above-written do appear. The
persons that fall into this direful case are, as soon as it is observed,
obliged to retire to a solitary little hut, built on purpose for them,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>at a distance from all houses, and are not allowed any converse with
their husbands, wives, or nearest relations, but have their necessaries
of life furnished them by a contribution from all the inhabitants
of the isle, and brought to their hut, which they take in when
the person who brought it has retired to the windward of their
house at some distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has never been any cure of this disease attempted here,
save that a few years ago a young woman in a neighbouring parish
had some bolusses of mercury given her in order to a salivation;
but some dangerous symptoms appearing, the administrator thought
fit to proceed no further, and the patient continues still alive in the
same case she was before taking the mercury.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the voluminous MS. Medical Notes, bequeathed by Sir
John Pringle to the College of Physicians of Edinburgh,<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> I find
a copy of the above account of the Papa lepers. Sir Andrew
Mitchell of Westshore seems to have transmitted the account to
him without giving any notice of the writer of it. It is entered
in Sir John&#8217;s notes under the date of 1759; but it was without
doubt drawn up many years previously. I have already alluded to
an entry in the Session Records of Walls, regarding the disappearance
of leprosy from that parish and district in 1742. The entry
seems to have been made at a sitting of the session &#8220;at North-house
in Papastour;&#8221; and its expressions<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> show that at the date
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>of it (17th March 1742) there were no lepers in Papa. From
the MS. extracts furnished to me by Mr. Rannie, session-clerk,
it appears that there is only mention of one other instance afterwards
in the Session-books of the parish, viz. in December 1772
and 1776. The female who was the subject of it, and whose
case is represented in the records as &#8220;singularly clamant,&#8221; was
ordered to be provided, at the expense of the session, &#8220;with back
and bed clothes, a house fit for her to lodge in, and maintenance
to be brought to her daily at the house.&#8221; Mr. Rannie further
states, &#8220;I have been informed by old persons that she lived but
a short time after she was put into the house built for her in
the common, at a distance from other houses.&#8221; He adds, &#8220;It has
been reported to me that in Papa, about the year 1778, a leprous
woman was put out and died in the fields before a house could
be built; and that about the same time there were leprous persons
in the district of Watness, and that the son and daughter of
a man Henry Sinclair were infected and sent to the hospital at
Edinburgh.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a still later date a case of Shetland leprosy was detected in
the Edinburgh Infirmary. In 1798, a male patient from Shetland
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>was for some time in the hospital wards, under the care of various
physicians. As the form of disease under which he laboured was
considered as very anomalous, Dr. Thomson was requested by Dr.
Hamilton to visit the patient, and detected the case to be one of
Greek elephantiasis. I am kindly permitted to extract the following
notes of the case from Dr. Thomson&#8217;s manuscripts:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;His face was studded all over with small subcutaneous tubercles.
The skin over these tubercles was of a reddish colour, intermixed
with blotches, like those which occur in the <i>pityriasis
versicolor</i>. The hair of the eyebrows and eyelids had fallen off,
and the skin of the face, as well as of most of the rest of the body,
seemed as if smeared with oil. His voice was weak and hoarse,
so that he seemed to speak as in a whisper. On inspecting the
fauces, they appeared in some places raw and excoriated, and in
others rough and puckered. A slight ulceration was perceptible
on the <i>septum narium</i>, and the nose seemed a little depressed.
In various parts of the body, particularly on the arms, thighs, and
legs, besides the small subcutaneous tubercles, other larger ones
were to be perceived by feeling for them. These larger bumps
or tubercles, which were not perceptible to the eye, and which did
not occasion any discoloration of the skin, were without pain, and
had a striking resemblance to the tubercles occurring in the flesh
of those affected with scurvy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The patient, John Berns, was 28 years of age. On making
inquiry, it was found (as I am informed by Dr. Thomson) that
some of his ancestors had been affected with the same disease.</p>

<p>An accurate drawing of the morbid appearances presented by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Berns&#8217; face was made at the time by Mr. Syme, now Professor of
Drawing in the Dollar Academy. A copy of this drawing, with
a history of the patient&#8217;s ailments, was forwarded to the late Dr.
Willan; and I have Dr. Thomson&#8217;s authority for stating that Dr.
Willan at once declared it also as his opinion, that Berns&#8217; case
was a genuine instance of the tuberculous leprosy or <i>Elephantiasis
Gr&aelig;corum</i>; a disease of which, as he informed Dr. Thomson,
he had only seen one example in a patient shown him by Dr.
Baillie.</p>

<p class="tb">Let us for a moment recapitulate the preceding evidence, with
regard to the nosological nature of the English and Scottish leprosy:&mdash;<i>First</i>,
various authors who personally witnessed the
leprosy of the middle ages upon the Continent of Europe, in
describing it, have described a disease having all the most characteristic
symptoms of Greek elephantiasis. <i>Secondly</i>, in England
a cutaneous disease prevailed at the same period, bearing the same
name,&mdash;presenting the same chronic incurable character,&mdash;having
its victims subjected to the same civil laws and restrictions,&mdash;marked
(as we know from Gilbert, Gaddesden, and Glanville&#8217;s
observations and writings) by the same train of nosological symptoms&mdash;and
hence identical in nature with the continental disease
and with the elephantiasis of the Greeks. <i>Thirdly</i>, in Scotland we
find a malady having the same similarity in its general date,&mdash;in
its name,&mdash;in its course,&mdash;and in the civil regulations enforced
regarding it, with its symptoms, as they are accidentally described
by Henryson in the sixteenth century, identical with those of Greek
elephantiasis. <i>Fourthly</i>, in a part of the country where the disease<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
has continued to prevail down to a later period, the infected, as
described by eye-witnesses in the earlier part of the last century,
presented the most unequivocal signs of the affection alluded to.
And, <i>lastly</i>, we have as high medical evidence as could be adduced
in regard to cutaneous affections (the evidence, namely, of Drs.
Willan and Thomson), for asserting that the malady was seen in
the members of a Shetland family in which it had been hereditarily
transmitted,&mdash;and hence, in one of the last, if not the very last
Scotch leper, was decidedly marked by the true and genuine characteristics
of the <i>Elephantiasis Gr&aelig;corum</i>.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Leprosy in the Northern Countries lying nearest to
Shetland.</span></p>

<p>On a former occasion I alluded to the existence of true tubercular
leprosy in the neighbouring Faroe Isles, in Iceland, and the
nearest coast of Norway, as corroborative of the disease which has
long existed in the Shetlands being of the same nosological nature.
I might now, if additional proof were necessary, reverse the order
of the evidence which I have just brought forward, and proceed
to show at length that the disease which long existed, and still
does remain, in Bergen and Iceland, and for which leper hospitals
also are still maintained in these localities, is, in reality, the tubercular
leprosy or Greek elephantiasis; and, from this point, argue
back, that the disease which formerly prevailed in Shetland,&mdash;and,
if in Shetland, in Scotland generally,&mdash;was of the same nosological
nature. On this head, however, I shall content myself with offering
a very few observations in proof of the specific character of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
malady in the districts lying most contiguous to Shetland, and
leave without further comment the inference deducible from such
evidence.</p>

<p><i>In the Faroe Isles.</i>&mdash;These islands form the nearest land north
of the Shetlands. The great cutaneous disease which formerly infected
the inhabitants of Faroe had all the characters of tubercular
leprosy. In proof of this, I may appeal to the description of the
malady, given in the seventeenth century by Debes, who was Provost
of the churches in these islands, and wrote an account, which
was much esteemed at the time, of the country and its inhabitants.
He observes, &#8220;As for the Leprosye itself, I would not omit, for the
reader&#8217;s sake, to mention something of its nature. Physicians write
that there are three sorts of Leprosies; namely, Tyria, from the
serpent Tyrus. In this leprosy, the patient&#8217;s skin is soft, and
sometimes falleth off in shells, and they have many spots and
white wartes thereon. The second is called Alopecia, by reason
the hairs fall off as those of a fox; he that is infected with this
leprosy hath a red face, and his beard and eyebrows fall off. The
third sort is called Elephantiasis, from the elephant, to whom they
become like in their skin; the body and face of him that is infected
with this disease is full of knobs. The Leprosie wherewith
they are troubled in this country is usually Elephantiasis, for the
face and limbs of almost all the infected are full of blue knobs,
that break out sometimes as boyls, whereby they look very deformed
in the face, being besides all hoarse, and speaking through
their noses.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>
<p><i>Iceland.</i>&mdash;That the leprosy of Iceland (the next land north of
the Faroe Isles) is of the nature of the <i>Elephantiasis Gr&aelig;corum</i>,
is a point which might be proved by any of the descriptions of it
by Petersen, Troil, Henderson, and Holland. Dr. Holland&#8217;s account
is more concise than the others. He states&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The leprosy of the Icelanders (<i>Likthra</i>, <i>Holdsveike</i>, or <i>Spitelska</i>),
exhibits in many instances all the essential characters of
the genuine elephantiasis or <i>Lepra Arabum</i>; and is a disease of
the most formidable and distressing kind. Indolent tumours of
the face and limbs are, generally, among the first symptoms of
the complaint, attended by swellings of the salivary, inguinal,
and axillary glands. The nostrils, ears, and lips are progressively
affected with swelling deformity. The skin over the whole,
or different parts of the body, becomes thick and hard; sometimes
exhibiting a shining or unctuous surface, sometimes one rough and
scabrous, which at a more advanced period of the disease displays
numerous cracks or fissures. The senses are usually much
enfeebled; and an&aelig;sthesia of the extremities generally occurs.
The voice assumes a peculiar hoarseness and nasal tone, frequently
with swelling of the tonsils, but without any hindrance of deglutition
until the disease has made great progress in the habits of
the patient: the breath and perspired matter are extremely fetid;
and the hairs and nails frequently fall off. The tumours in
different parts of the body gradually pass into malignant ulcers,
which discharge an acrid unhealthy matter; in this state the
patient often lingers during a long time; or where the disease
has a more speedy termination, all the symptoms are rapidly aggra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>vated,
and he is carried off in a state of extreme debility and
wretchedness.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></p>

<p>The lepers in Iceland are received into four different hospitals,
which have been long established for that purpose.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p><i>Norway.</i>&mdash;Returning again to Shetland as a starting point, we
find that the part of the continent of Europe which lies nearest to
Shetland, and that in nearly a direct line westward, is the district
of Bergen in Norway. The distance between Shetland and the
seaport of Bergen does not exceed thirty geographical degrees.
In the first part of the present essay I offered some reasons for
believing that the spedalskhed prevalent in Bergen was a disease
different, on the one hand, from the radesyge of other parts of
Norway, and probably identical on the other hand with the Greek
elephantiasis or tubercular leprosy.</p>

<p>The descriptions of those authors who had observed the disease
at Bergen seemed to justify this view. In 1751 Pontoppidan,
the Bishop of Bergen, cites the account and words which we
have above quoted from Debes in reference to the Faroe Isles,
as exactly applying to the disease in the district of Bergen.
When it at last (he states) breaks out in ugly boils on the face,
they are generally sent to hospitals erected for that purpose, of
which there is one at Bergen and another at Molde in Romsdalen.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>
The excellent account of the disease in the Bergen hospital, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>was drawn up a few years ago by the preacher Wellhaven, shows
the malady to correspond in every important particular with the
Greek elephantiasis;<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> and the long and more strictly medical
description of the Bergen disease given in 1786 by Buchner,<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a>
appeared to be altogether confirmatory of the same opinion. I
have lately become acquainted with a proof to the same effect, of
such a strong character as to render it supererogatory to adduce
the detailed descriptions of Buchner or Wellhaven in evidence.
The Norwegian Government has recently (and with an anxiety
towards the promotion of medical science that reflects little honour
on the other richer courts of Europe) commissioned some of its
more distinguished physicians to institute a complete inquiry into
the nature of the endemic cutaneous diseases both of Norway and
of other localities. Since the former part of the present paper was
printed, Dr. F&auml;ye of Christiania has, as one of these commissioners,
visited this country with the purpose of examining into the nature
of the Scottish sibbens, etc.; and I have learned from him with
pleasure that the physician sent to Bergen to examine the spedalskhed,
is prepared, after a careful study of the disease there, to
report it as tubercular leprosy, and hence a species of malady perfectly
distinct from the more general Scandinavian radesyge.</p>

<p class="tb">The date of the first appearance of leprosy in the Faroe Isles
and in Iceland seems to remain undetermined.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> In both localities
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>it appears to have prevailed severely in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> In all probability, however, it was introduced long previous
to these dates. At all events, it appeared much earlier in
Bergen, for, as I have already stated in the first part, one of the
leper hospitals in that city was founded as early as the year 1268.</p>

<p class="tb">There is no evidence, as far as I know, of the period of its first
appearance in Shetland. It had reached, however, as far as the north
of Scotland early in the thirteenth century; for, as we have already
shown, the leper hospital of Elgin was in existence in the year
1226,<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> or more than forty years, at least, previously to the institution
of similar receptacles for the diseased in Bergen.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Errors in adjudging Individuals to the Leper Hospitals&mdash;Cautions
inculcated by the Medical Authorities.</span></p>

<p>While arguing, as I have done in the preceding paragraphs, to
show that the epidemic leprosy for which so many lazar-houses
were formerly founded in Europe and in Great Britain was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Greek elephantiasis, I by no means wish to insist that patients
affected with that disease alone were admitted into these receptacles.
There is only too great probability for the belief that persons
who had the misfortune to be affected with any foul and inveterate
cutaneous malady were isolated and shut up along with those
actually labouring under true leprosy. After syphilis appeared,
towards the commencement of the sixteenth century, with some
analogous symptoms, and when the elephantiasis itself was already
disappearing from most localities, we know for certain that a large
proportion of the inmates of the continental lazar-houses consisted
of cases of secondary venereal and other severe skin-affections.
Dr. Bateman<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> adduces the strongest possible evidence in proof of
this from the direct and personal observations made in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries in the leper hospital at Ulm by Horst,
at Alcmaer by Forrestus, and by Reedlin at Vienna. Similar
errors were in all probability only too common even when the
elephantiasis was more common and better known, and mistakes in
the selection of the proper inmates of the hospitals would constantly
occur in these times, from the kind of persons to whom the responsible
and important task of selecting the infected was entrusted.
The Act that we have already quoted of the Perth Parliament
&#8220;anent lipper-folk&#8221; defines those who were charged in Scotland
with the duty of searching out the affected. In the third clause
it is statute &#8220;That the Bishoppes, Officialles and Deanes, inquyre
diligentlie in their visitation of ilk (each) Paroch Kirk, gif ony be
smitted (affected) with Lipper, and gif ony sik (such) be foundin,
that they be delivered to the king gif they be Seculares, and gif
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>they be Clerkes, to their Bishoppes, and that the Burgesses gar
(oblige them to) keepe this statute under the paine conteined in
the statute of Beggers [namely, gif they have broken it (the statute
of beggars) they sall be in fourtie shillings to the King]; and
quhat leprous that keepis not this statute, that he be banished
for ever off that Burgh, quhair he disobeyis, and in likewise to
Landwart.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p>In extenuation of the above edict, we must recollect that, at
the period at which it was enacted (in 1427), the ecclesiastics to
whom in this country it entrusted the selection of lepers were in
reality the only existing physicians of the general community, and
some of them seem to have devoted themselves as much to the
practice of medicine as to the study of theology. But, even to a
strictly non-medical observer, the diagnosis would, in the latter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>stages, be less free from doubt than might be at first supposed.
For when once the tubercular leprosy became in any case completely
developed in all its distinctive deformity, and with its full concourse
of marked and peculiar external characters, as falling off of the hairs
of the eyebrows, swelling and thickening of these parts, tubercles
of the face, hoarseness of the voice, etc., there were few or no diseases
for which it could be readily mistaken, provided any proper degree
of care was observed. In the earlier stages and less marked cases
of the disease, errors in the adjudgment of cases, in all probability,
often occurred, and affections that had no relation to elephantiasis,
except in their obstinacy and locality, were, we cannot doubt,
frequently mistaken for true instances of tubercular leprosy.</p>

<p>Such errors, it has been often averred, would be almost as apt
to happen in the hands of the truly medical, as of the non-medical
examiners, in consequence of the knowledge and distinction of
cutaneous diseases being exceedingly imperfect at these early
periods of medical history. And it is certainly true that, in the
writings of the older Arabian, Continental, and English physicians,
we find almost all the different species of chronic cutaneous disease
mixed up and described together under a few general heads and
designations, as Lentigo, Impetigo, Morphea, Albaras, Gutta Rosea,
etc. Indeed,the proper discrimination and diagnosis of different
cutaneous affections was little known and studied until the end of
the last century. At the same time, however, it must be recollected
that the tubercular lepra, or Greek elephantiasis, certainly forms a
striking exception to this general observation. For, in the medical
writings of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and early part of the fifteenth
century, the leprosy is almost uniformly described with a care and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
a minuteness that strangely contrasts with the superficial manner
in which the whole remainder of chronic cutaneous diseases are
either passed over or confounded together.</p>

<p>I would willingly appeal, in support of this last allegation, to
the different chapters on lepra, as compared with those on the other
cutaneous diseases, in the works of the Arabian physicians, and of
those European medical authors of the middle ages whose writings
I have already referred to. Indeed, the accounts and diagnosis of
tubercular lepra, as given by Rhazes, Theodoric, Lanfranc, Arnold
de Villeneuve, Gilbert, etc., might well stand as models of medical
description even at the present day. And if, in France, the strong
and earnest injunctions of Bernhard Gordon were in any degree
respected, that no person be adjudged as requiring separation for
leprosy until the second stage (according to his division of the
disease) had supervened, and the <i>signa infallibilia</i> of the malady
had already shown themselves in the usual marks traceable in the
<i>corruptio figurae et formae</i> of the suspected individual, cases of
unjust condemnation to the lazar-houses would be much less
common than might be otherwise imagined. We have already
seen that in England, in the fourteenth century, John of Gaddesden
inculcated the same salutary rules and precautions, and insisted
that no one be separated from the general community as a leper,
unless already &#8220;<i>figura et forma faciei corrumpantur</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Certainly, on some occasions, the examination to which the
patient was subjected, in order to ascertain if he were truly a leper
or not, seems to have been of the most searching and scrutinising
nature. I have already alluded to the strict rules of examination
that have been preserved for us in the works of different authors,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
and quoted the method recommended by Guy de Chauliac to be
followed by physicians before they remitted suspected patients
with medical certificates to the magistrates (<i>cum literis medicorum
ad rectores</i>). In the <i>Examen Leprosorum</i>, published by Gesner,
and which appears to have been drawn up as an official formula,
if I may so term it, for examining into suspected cases, the details
are most elaborate and searching. There are between fifty and
sixty signs of the disease which the examiner is requested to look
for. Twelve of these signs are taken from the general state of the
body; seven or eight of them from the hands and feet; six from
the blood; five from the face; six from the mouth; eight from the
eyes and eyebrows, etc. etc. The document commences by stating,
&#8220;that it is the duty of the physician to be versed in, and attentive
to, the signs of the disease, and to ponder often (<i>revolvere multoties</i>)
upon them. He should put his trust (it adds) not in one sign, but
in many, and he should see what signs are proper (<i>propria</i>) to the leprosy, and what are equivocal.&#8221; Before making the examination,
the document states that (as is also recommended by Guy de
Chauliac<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> and others), the physician should, in the first instance,
give some words of encouragement and consolation to the patient,
and show that this disease is the salvation of his soul, and that
Christ has not despised such, although the world may shun them
(<i>quod haec aegritudo salus est animae, et tales Christus non despexit</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span><i>licet mundus cos fugiat</i>). Further, in order to have more certainty
in the examination, it is added that the patient should be made,
in the first place, to take oath to tell the truth on those points on
which he is interrogated. We have already found De Chauliac
recommending the examining physician to take the same precaution,
&#8220;faciat eos <i>jurare</i> veritatem dicere de interrogendis&#8221; (p. 310).</p>

<p>A decree, issued in the year 1314, by Milo, Bishop of Orleans,
shows that it was occasionally necessary to guard the examinators
against being imposed on in other more serious ways, than by direct
prevarications or misstatements on the part of the suspected individuals
who are subjected to their scrutiny. &#8220;Whereas it happens
that in the examination of lepers mistakes as to identity, and
deceptions, are caused by the interposition of other persons, we
enact and command that whenever any person is suspected of the
infection of leprosy, he be sent at his own charge if he have effects,
but if not, that two responsible men of the parish having been
sworn (<i>jurati</i>) before the priest and the officers of the church
(<i>gajariis ecclesiae</i>), be sent at the expense of the parish with the
suspected person to obtain the examination; they shall conduct the
said suspected person to the said examination, and cause him to
be faithfully examined, and bring certificates to us, that it may not
be possible that, for the future, collusion should take place in the
aforesaid matters.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></p>

<p>I have not hitherto been able to find any evidence showing
to whom the examination and seclusion of lepers was, in olden
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>times, entrusted in England; or to trace out in that kingdom any
special laws relative to this subject. There exist, however, upon
record, in reference to one English case in the fifteenth century,
some details that are particularly interesting in regard to the
present point of our inquiry. The details in question have been
preserved in Rymer&#8217;s <i>F&oelig;dera</i>. The case to which they refer appears
to have been brought under the cognisance of the Crown by the
neighbours of the suspected female, in consequence of her being
alleged to be affected with leprosy, and yet refusing to seclude
herself, as was the usual custom, from intercourse with society in
consequence of it. The reigning monarch, Edward IV., issued, in
1468, a Chancery warrant for the proper medical examination of
this supposed case of the disease. The royal warrant, and the
medical certificate which it called forth, have both been preserved
by Rymer. I append a translation of these curious documents, as
illustrative both of the general dread then still entertained of the
malady, and of the minute care which, in this country, was occasionally
taken, in order that a just and accurate judgment might
be arrived at in cases of doubt and difficulty. The documents are
entered by Rymer under the title of &#8220;Medicorum Regis, super
morbo Lepr&aelig;, Certificatio.&#8221; They proceed as follows:&mdash;</p>

with regard to removing <i>Johanna Nightingale</i>, of Brentwoode,
in the County of Essex, from general intercourse with mankind (<i>a

her neighbours that she was infected by the foul contact of Leprosy,
and was, in fact, herself a Leper: Upon which Your writ was then

We have heard that <i>Johanna Nightingale</i> is a leper, and is commonly
holding intercourse with the people of the aforesaid county,
and mixes with them both in public and private places, and refuses
to retire to a solitary place, as is customary and befitting her (<i>et se

the aforesaid disease, the manifest perils of the aforesaid inhabitants:
We, willing to guard against such dangers, as far as in us lies, and
as is just and customary in such cases, Do charge You, that having
taken with You certain discreet and loyal men of the county of
the aforesaid <i>Johanna</i>, in order to obtain a better knowledge of this
disease, You go to the aforesaid <i>Johanna</i>, and cause her to be
diligently viewed and examined in the presence of the aforesaid
men. And if You find her to be leprous, as was reported of her,
then that You cause her to be removed, in as decent a manner as
possible, from all intercourse with other persons, and have her
betake herself immediately (<i>indilat&egrave;</i>) to a secluded place, as is the
custom, lest by common intercourse of this kind injury or danger
should in any wise happen to the aforesaid inhabitants. Witness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>

<p>&#8220;Wherefore The Reverend Father in God, Robert, by the
Grace of God, Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells, Your Chancellor
of England, consulted us on this subject, and determined to bring
the same Johanna to us, with the intention that, according to what
we have learned from our knowledge of Medicine, we should give
information to Your Highness in Your Chancery, whether the said
Johanna be in fact a Leper or not. We, therefore, wishing to
obey Your Highness, in order that the truth on this subject
might be made most plain and clear, have proceeded after this
manner. First, we examined her person, and as the older and most
learned medical authors have directed in these cases, we touched
and handled her (<i>ipsam tradavimus et palpavimus</i>), and made
mature, diligent, and proper investigation, whether the symptoms,
indicative of this disease, were in her or not; and after an examination
and consideration of each of the points, which appeared
necessary to be examined and considered, in order to arrive at a
true knowledge of this doubtful matter, We found that the woman
neither had been nor was a Leper, nor ought, on that account, to be
separated from ordinary intercourse with mankind.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are taught by Medical Science that the disease of Leprosy
is known by many signs, also that each species of the disease, of
which there are four, viz. Alopecia, Tiria, Leonina, and Elephantia,
should be known and characterised by particular signs, and each
should be specifically distinguished from the rest. Therefore, in
the case of the woman brought before us, on going through upwards
of twenty-five of the more marked (<i>famosiora</i>) signs of general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
leprosy (<i>Leprae in communi</i>), we do not find that she can be
proved to be leprous, by them or a sufficient number of them.
And this would suffice, generally, to free her from the suspicion of
leprosy, since it is not possible for any to labour under the disease,
in whom the greater part of these signs are not found. But, in
order to give our opinion on the individual species, going through
upwards of forty distinctive signs of the different varieties of
leprosy, we do not find that this woman is to be marked as suffering
under any of the four kinds, but is utterly free and untainted,
as we have signified by word of mouth to Your Highness in Your
said Chancery, and we are prepared to declare the same more fully
to Your Highness by scientific process (<i>per processum scientificum</i>),
if, and wherever, it shall be necessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;In testimony whereof, we, the said William Hatticlyff, Roger
Marshall, and Dominus de Serego, have signed our name with our
proper hands, and alternately affixed our seals.&#8221;</p>

<h3>PART III.</h3>

<p class="center3">THE ETIOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE DISEASE.</p>

<p class="tb">To conclude the present hurried sketch of the British leprosy
of the middle ages, it now only remains for me to consider, in
relation to the etiology or causation of the disease, the rank, age,
sex, etc., of those that were attacked by it; the effects of its hereditary
transmission; and the question of its propagation by contagion.
In connection with this last subject, I shall attempt to
bring together under one view the stringent regulations and usages
that were adopted by our ancestors, with a view of preventing the
diffusion of the disease by means of communication between the
infected and the healthy; and at the same time consider the light
in which the despised lepers were regarded both by the civil and
ecclesiastical law.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Rank of the Persons attacked by Leprosy.</span></p>

<p>In this country the leprosy of the middle ages seems to have
had its largest share of victims in the lower classes of society&mdash;amongst
the &#8220;villeyns&#8221; or bondsmen of these times, and the poorer
peasantry and burgesses, who, when shut up in the hospitals, were
obliged either to depend upon the funds of these institutions, or to
beg for their support. The exact trade and calling of the individuals
admitted into the Scottish and English hospitals can only be very
imperfectly gathered from one or two casual notices.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>
<p>Among the patients of Kingcase leper hospital, in Ayrshire, I
have only found one whose rank I can trace. In the burgh of
Prestwick<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> records for 1478-9, Anne Kerd is formally accused
before the magistrates of the burgh of visiting Kingcase, and further
&#8220;hir seik soun, att is lepper, repairis daili in her house [in Prestwick].&#8221;
This Anne Kerd, having &#8220;a sick son that is leprous&#8221;
seems from the old <i>Liber Communitatis</i>, etc., <i>de Prestwick</i> of 1470
to have had assigned her a very small fragment of the burgh lands
only, viz. &#8220;a porciunkle of commoun lande quilk acht after hir lyve
to John Haveris airis (which belonged after her life [death] to John
Haveris&#8217; heirs).&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></p>

<p>Amongst the citizens of Glasgow who were at different times in
the latter part of the sixteenth century ordered by the magistrates
to be visited, under the suspicion of labouring under leprosy, most
are recorded by their mere Christian name and surname; but two
or three are entered in the burgh records in such terms as to show
their occupation and probable rank, as &#8220;Robert &mdash;&mdash;, fleschor,&#8221; in
1573; &#8220;Mr. James &mdash;&mdash;, fleschor,&#8221; &#8220;Patrick Bogle, maltman,&#8221; and
&#8220;Andro Lawson, merchand,&#8221; in 1581.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> One of these individuals is
reported by the Water Bailies as confined in the Glasgow leper
hospital at the Brigend<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> in 1589, along with five other lepers.
The whole list is interesting for our present purpose, as showing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>the trade and calling of the infected inmates, viz. &#8220;Andro Lawson,
<i>merchand</i>; Stevin Gilmor, <i>cordener</i>; Robert Bogill, sone to Patrick
Bogle; Patrick Birstall, <i>tailzeour</i>; Johne Thomsoun, sone to Johne
Thomsoune, <i>tailzeour</i>; Daniel Cunninghame, <i>tinclar</i>.&#8221;&#8221;</p>

<p>I am not aware of the existence of any similar complete list of
the inmates of other British leper hospitals, to which I could refer
with the view of ascertaining the occupation and rank of those that
occupied them. We have scattered records, however, to show that
men of riches occasionally became the victims of the disease, and
passed their subsequent term of life in the leper hospitals. Thus,
Jenkins, in speaking of the St.&nbsp;Mary Magdalene lazar-house at
Exeter, states, &#8220;Richard Orange, Esq., a gentleman of noble
parentage, and mayor of this city (Exeter) in 1454, being infected
with the leprosy, notwithstanding his great wealth, submitted himself
to a residence in this hospital, where he lived many years, and
finished his days, and was buried in the chancel of the chapel. His
grave, with a mutilated inscription, is still extant.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<p>Some of the leper hospitals were specially endowed for persons
above the lower ranks, who happened to become affected with the
disease. In 1491, Robert Pigot gave by will to the leper hospital
of Walsingham, in the archdeaconry of Norwich, a house in or near
that town for the use of two leprous persons &#8220;of good families.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></p>

<p>The malady was found among the clergy as well as among the
laity, and some of the English leper hospitals were specially founded
for the reception of leprous monks alone&mdash;as the hospital of St.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>Lawrence, near Canterbury, and, according to Tanner,<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> that of St.
Bartholomew, at Chatham. From one of the edicts issued by Henry
II. during the height of his quarrel with Archbishop Becket, it
would appear that the dignitaries of the church occasionally did,
or at least might, employ lepers in the high character of nuncios,
for, in order to prevent Becket from putting the kingdom of England
under an ecclesiastical interdict, Henry took all precautions that no
official letters to that effect should be conveyed into Britain; and
to secure this object the more surely, he enacted, that, if any
individual did carry thither letters of interdict from the Pope or
Archbishop, he should be punished &#8220;by the amputation of his feet
if a regular; by the loss of his eyes and by castration, if a secular
clergyman; he should be hanged if he were a layman; and burned
if he were a leper&#8221; (<i>si Leprosus, comburatur</i>).<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></p>

<p>In the extant account of the British leper hospitals, there are
still preserved some instances in which these institutions were
founded by the wealthy and noble after they had themselves become
the victims of the malady. The leper hospital of Mayden Bradley, in
Wiltshire, was founded by a female member of the rich family of the
Bysets<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a>&mdash;Camden alleges by a daughter of Manasser Byset, sewer
to King Henry II., after she had herself become a leper. &#8220;This
hospital,&#8221; says Leland, &#8220;was builded by one of the three heirs
general of the Bisets, who, being a lazar, gave her part of the town
of Kidderminster <i>in pios usus</i>.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>If the earlier biographical notices that we possess regarding the
nobility of Great Britain were as minute on their private as on
their martial and political lives, we might probably have to record
many more notices in regard to their bodily maladies of an import
similar to the following:&mdash;The youngest son of Robert Blanchmains,
Earl of Leicester, was himself a leper, and in the reign of
Richard II. founded a leper hospital, dedicated to St.&nbsp;Leonard, on
the north part of the town of Leicester.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<p>The royal families of England and Scotland did not always
remain exempt from the suspicion, at least, and accusation of
leprosy, if not from the actual attack of the disease.</p>

<p>Henry III. courted Margaret, Princess of Scotland, and the
sister of Malcolm IV. The royal lady preferred the brave Hubert
de Burgh, the minister of the English king. Hubert&#8217;s enemies
afterwards alleged to King Henry, that he (Hubert) had dissuaded
the Scottish princess from accepting the hand of the English
monarch, by telling her &#8220;that Henry was a squint-eyed fool, a lewd
man, a <i>leper</i>, deceitful, perjured, more faint-hearted than a woman,
and utterly unfit for the company of any fair and noble lady.&#8221;&mdash;(Articles
of Impeachment, as given by Speed.)<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></p>

<p>In reference to this unfounded accusation, I may state that
Ryland mentions it as a local tradition that the leper-house of
Waterford in Ireland was founded by King John (the father of
Henry III.) in consequence of his son&#8217;s being affected at Lismore
with an eruption that was supposed to be leprosy.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> But even sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>posing
the tradition correct, it could scarcely have been Henry the
eldest legitimate son of John, since, at the date of his father&#8217;s expedition
into Ireland, 1209 and 1210, Henry was a child of only
five or six years of age, and in all probability did not accompany
his royal sire.</p>

<p>Different historians have alleged that Henry IV. was affected
with leprosy in the latter part of his life. The immediate cause of
his death seems to have been epilepsy, terminating, after a time, in
an apoplectic attack; and some authors aver strongly that this was
his only disease. Thus, in his Chronicles of England,<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> the celebrated
old printer, Grafton, upholds that Henry was carried off by
&#8220;a sore and sudaine disease called an apoplexie.&#8221; Hall, an
author somewhat anterior in date, stoutly maintains this same view,
for the king&#8217;s disease, as he observes, &#8220;was no lepry striken by
the hand of God, as folish friers before declared, for then he neither
would for shame nor for debility enterprize (as he did), so greate
a journey as into Jewrie (Jerusalem), in his own persone, but he
was taken with a sore apoplexye.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<p>Hollinshed,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> quoting implicitly this account from &#8220;Maister
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>Hall,&#8221; gravely adds, and he &#8220;had none other greefe nor maladie.&#8221;
The dogmatic authority of Hall on this, as on other points, is not
to be over much relied upon.</p>

<p>We have little doubt that Dr. Lingard<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> had some sufficient
evidence from the records of the times, for stating that Henry had
at least &#8220;the most loathsome eruptions on his face.&#8221; Rapin<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> and
Turner,<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> in their histories of England, both refer to Mezeray as
their authority for averring that these eruptions consisted of leprosy.
I find that Duchesne<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> also describes Henry as weighed down
with a severe and grievous affection of leprosy; and Maydestone<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a>
alleges that it was this last disease, and solemnly considers it as a
punishment inflicted on the king for his cruel treatment of Archbishop
Scrope. Iohn Hardynge, whose authority is the more
valuable from his being himself a contemporary of Henry IV., and
a follower of his son, Henry V., describes in his rhyming Chronicles
of English History the face of the king as disfigured by leprosy.
As a portion of the last personal confessions of the monarch,
Hardynge puts into his mouth the following penitent lamentations
regarding the changes which the ravages of the disease had wrought
upon his frame and face:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i05">&#8220;This wormes mete, this carryon full vnquert,</div>
<div class="line">That some tyme thought in worlde it had ne pere;</div>
<div class="line">This face so foule that <i>Leprous</i> doth apere,</div>
<div class="line"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>That here afore I have had such a pride</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>These observations are certainly by no means sufficient either
decidedly to confirm or controvert the opinion that Henry IV. was
affected with leprosy; but they serve at least to show that, at the
time at which he lived, rank of the highest kind was not considered
as any adequate barrier against an attack of the disease.</p>

<p>In none of these alleged cases of leprosy in the royal family of
England is the proof of the actual existence of the disease at all
indubitable and complete. The evidence is more certain and
satisfactory in regard to the occurrence of the malady, in its genuine
form, in other scions of the House of Anjou than those who ascended
the throne of England. I allude especially to the case of Baldwin
IV., King of Jerusalem, a direct descendant, like the royal Plantagenets
of England, from Fulk, Count of Anjou and Touraine. All
historians seem to agree in stating Baldwin IV. to have laboured
for some years under elephantiasis, and to have ultimately resigned
his sceptre in consequence of disability from that disease. He was,
says Fuller, when speaking of him under the year 1174, &#8220;enclined
to the leprosie called elephantiasis.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> By the year 1183, &#8220;the
leprosie had arrested him prisoner and kept him at home. Long&#8221;
(adds the same historian) &#8220;had the king&#8217;s spirit endured this
infirmity, swallowing many a bitter pang with a smiling face, and
going upright with patient shoulders under the weight of his disease.
It made him put all his might to it, because when he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>yielded to his sicknesse, he must leave off the managing of the
State; and he was loth to put off his royal robes before he went to
bed, a crown being too good a companion for one to part with
willinglie. But at last he was made to stoop, and retired himself
to a private life.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></p>

<p>The disease, as has been above observed, did not spare the royal
family of Scotland. At least two cases of leprosy are alleged to
have occurred among the members of it. The first and earliest of
these, however, is much more a matter of fable than of fact, and the
story, as told us by Hector Boece and Dempster, is, in all probability,
due rather to their love of historical romance than their knowledge
of historical records. Fiacre, the subject of it, still holds a place as
a saint in the Catholic calendars of France and Germany. Among
the long list of oaths<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> which Rabelais, in his Pantagruel, long ago
put into the mouth of the garrulous Panurge, one is an imprecation
&#8220;par l&#8217;espine de Saint Fiacre.&#8221; This Saint Fiacre or St.&nbsp;Fithulk
(as he was sometimes termed) was the reputed son of Eugenius IV.
King of Scotland. Preferring a cloister to a court, he is said to
have retired into France, and to have led the life of a religious
solitary in a cell granted to him by Pharo, Bishop of Meaux. After
his father was dead and his brother deposed, the Scottish nobles
sent a deputation to Fiacre with an offer of the throne of his
ancestors. But &#8220;quhen (to state the result in Boece&#8217;s words) thir
ambassatouris was brocht to his presence, he apperit to thair sicht
sa ful of <i>lipper</i>, that he was repute be thaim the maist horribill
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>creature in erd&#8221; (on earth).<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> Spottiswood fixes the era of his
death in the year 665.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></p>

<p>The case of King Robert the Bruce is a more recent and a more
authenticated instance of leprosy in the royal family of Scotland.
All authorities agree in stating that the Bruce suffered under a
&#8220;lang seknes,&#8221; as Wyntoun<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> expresses it. Froissart, who visited
the Scottish Court in the reign of his grandson Robert II., describes,
in more than one passage, the Bruce as having been afflicted with
and died of &#8220;<i>la grosse maladie</i>,&#8221; &#8220;sore greved with ye great sickenes&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a>
as Lord Berners has translated it.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> In their editions of Froissart&#8217;s
works, Sauvage,<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> Buchon,<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> and Johnes,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> severally comment upon
&#8220;la grosse maladie&#8221; of Froissart, as signifying the leprosy. I have
already adverted to this expression as being quite synonymous in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>words and meaning with the Saxon term for the disease. Further,
that Bruce was really affected with and died of leprosy, seems to be
borne out by the evidence of the older historians. Hemingford, a
contemporary of Bruce&#8217;s, describes him as &#8220;lepra percussus;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> and
Walsingham uses the same language both in his <i>Chronica</i><a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> and in
his <i>Ypodigma Neustri&aelig;</i>;<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> Boece speaks of Bruce as dying of leprosy
(ex lepra fato concessit);<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> and Buchanan gives to his disease the
more unequivocal name of elephantiasis (&#8220;nam in elephantiam incederat&#8221;).<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a>
Leland, in the translation which he has given in the
first volume of his <i>Collectanea</i> from the famous <i>Scalacronica</i>, speaks
of ambassadors being sent from England to &#8220;Murrefe (Moray), the
guardiane of Scotlande in the nonage of King Davy, whos fader
dyed of the Lepre;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> &#8220;<i>qui mort estoit de lepre</i>,&#8221; in the words of the
original works.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> In the old and valuable <i>Chronicle of Lanercost</i>,
which has only been for the first time printed within the last two
years, the disease and death of the Bruce are mentioned in terms
equally precise. In speaking (p. 254) of Randolph and Douglas
entering England in 1326, the Chronicle states that the Scottish
army was not led by Bruce in person, because &#8220;factus erat Leprosus.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
His death is thus announced in a subsequent page (264) of these
old and probably contemporary records, under the year 1329,
&#8220;mortuus est Dominus Robertus Brus, Rex Scoti&aelig;, leprosus.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shall close these remarks by alluding to one other reputed
case of leprosy in a descendant of the royal families of Scotland.
The celebrated Constance, Duchess of Britanny, who was allied
to the royal families both of England and Scotland (being a granddaughter
of Malcolm III. of Scotland, and the English Princess
Margaret Atheling, and at the same time a descendant of a natural
daughter of Henry I.), is generally alleged by historians to have
suffered and died from leprosy.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> William of Nangris (as Lobineau
observes) &#8220;has shown that she died of leprosy (<i>de la lepre</i>), a disease
with which females were occasionally attacked in these times.&#8221;
Lobineau places the date of the decease of Constance in the year
1201.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Sex of the Lepers.</span></p>

<p class="tb">The modern history of tubercular leprosy would seem to show
that the disease attacks the male in a larger proportion than the
female sex. From the table which Dr. Adams collected and published
of patients admitted into the leper-house of Funchal,
Madeira,<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> from 1702 to 1803, it appears that during that period
526 infected males were admitted into the hospital, while the corresponding
list of infected females amounts only to 373. The

and those entered into the Greenside hospital of Edinburgh in 1591
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>(the only two old lists of patients of such institutions in Britain
that I am acquainted with), show the diseased inmates of these two
establishments to have been all males. A large proportion of the
English lazar-houses seem, from the language of their charters, to
have been endowed entirely for males (<i>fratres leprosi</i>), but, at the
same time, we have abundant evidence in the same documents that
females often suffered from the disease.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> Some of the lazar-houses
were founded and endowed for admitting infected inmates of both
sexes (<i>fratres et sorores lepros&aelig;</i>). Thus Tanner states that the old
lazar-house of St.&nbsp;Nicolas, York, contained both male and female
lepers.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> Mackarell and Bridges both mention the same fact with
regard to the hospitals of St.&nbsp;Nicolas at Lynne Regis,<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> and of St.
Leonard at Northampton;<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> and the inmates of the leper-house of
St.&nbsp;Giles, Shrewsbury, bore, according to Owen and Blakeway,<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> the
style of the prior, brethren and sisters of St.&nbsp;Giles. A few of the
English hospitals were indeed entirely devoted to the reception of
leprous females. Thus the hospital of Mayden Bradley was founded
in the time of Henry II. for those of the female sex only (<i>pro mulieribus
leprosis</i>); and the hospital of St.&nbsp;James, Westminster (which,
says Bishop Tanner, stood on or near the place now occupied by the
palace of the same name), was destined, as the renewed charter of
Henry III. bears, for fourteen leprous girls (<i>quatuordecim Leprosis
puellis</i>).<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Age of those attacked&mdash;Duration of the Disease.</span></p>

<p>There are no documents (as far as I am aware) which directly
throw any light on the age of the inmates of the leper hospitals.
The expression, however, of <i>puell&aelig;</i>, which I have just quoted as
applied to the inmates of St.&nbsp;James&#8217; Hospital, shows the youth not
less than the sex of the inmates of that institution, and so far
demonstrates that the disease then, as it does now, sometimes
attacked its victims very early in life. Baldwin IV. of Jerusalem,
(whose case I have already referred to) was affected with the disease
while still a minor, and surrendered his crown at the age of 23, in
consequence of the ravages which the disease had by that time
made upon his constitution. &#8220;He died young,&#8221; says Fuller, &#8220;at
five-and-twenty years of age&mdash;a king happie in this, that he died
before the death of his kingdome.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></p>

<p>King Robert the Bruce, another, as we have already seen, of the
royal victims of the malady, died at the age of 55.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> But it is difficult
to fix the precise date of the first attack of the disease in the case
of the Scottish king, and hence difficult to deduce the exact duration
of the malady in this particular instance. His faithful biographer,
Barbour, describes him as &#8220;tuk with sic a sicknes&#8221; before the battle
of Inverury in 1307, &#8220;that he mycht nothyr rid na ga&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a>&mdash;(that he
might neither ride nor walk). Kerr, in his <i>History of the Life and
Reign of the Bruce</i>, seems to hint that this was the commencement
of the disease which ultimately carried him off;<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> and indeed Barbour,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>in a subsequent part of his poem, describes his fatal malady as
&#8220;beguth&#8221;&mdash;(begun)</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="tb">But if the affection commenced in so acute a form at that date, it
must have lasted for the long period of twenty-two years, as his
death did not take place till 1329. If the disease under which the
king suffered so severely in 1307 had been leprosy, it would not in
all probability have left his activity and individual prowess for so
long a date unimpaired. The battle-axe which, on the evening
before the battle of Bannockburn, cleft at a single blow the helmet
and skull of Henry de Bohun, could scarcely have been wielded by
the arm of one whose body had for some years previously been the
seat of a mortal disease. Some facts, however, would seem to show
that the malady had assumed a marked and severe form a considerable
time before the Bruce&#8217;s death. I have already shown,
from the <i>Chronicle of Lanercost</i>, that three years before his demise
the Bruce was already so incapacitated by the inroads of the leprosy
that he was unable to undertake the command of the army in their
descent upon the northern counties of England.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> The same reason
rendered him, as we are informed by Barbour, unable to attend the
peaceful nuptial feast of his son at Berwick in 1328. It may not
be considered uninteresting to add, as a part both of the history of
the man and of the disease under which he was labouring, that
during these three last years of his life, and whilst &#8220;the sicknes&#8221;
affected his body &#8220;so fellely&#8221; (to use Barbour&#8217;s words), &#8220;and him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>trawaillat sa that he considered death certen,&#8221; his naturally energetic
mind was still active and vigorous. The accounts of his chamberlain,
preserved in the Register House of Edinburgh,<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> show that, during
the very last year of his life, he was busied in making experiments
on ship-building and navigation in his retirement at Cardross Castle,
near the banks of the Clyde, in Dumbartonshire. Within a month
before his death, he indited from this place a letter (the original of
which still exists among the old archives of Melrose Abbey, preserved
in the General Register House, Edinburgh<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a>), desiring his
heart to be buried within the precincts of that monastery,&mdash;a wish
which he changed, a short time before he expired, into the well-known
commission to his favourite follower and friend, &#8220;ye gentle
knighte of Douglas,&#8221; viz. &#8220;I woll yat, as soone as I am trespassed

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Hereditary Transmission of the Leprosy.</span></p>

<p>Few facts in the history of tubercular leprosy seem to be more
universally admitted by all writers on the disease, both ancient
and modern, than the transmission of the predisposition to it from
parents to offspring. The Greek and Arabian physicians considered
it as a malady in which all the fluids of the body were equally
diseased (corrumpens pariter omnes humores corporis). &#8220;Fit itaque
(adds Haly Abbas, the well-known Arabian author of the tenth
century, in his chapter &#8220;De Elephantia&#8221;), &#8220;cum humoribus spermatis
corruptio, cum et humores et sperma ex sanguine fiant, in tantum,
ut in generatione passio haec transeat in filios.&#8221; (Theoric, lib.
viii. cap. 15.) Avicenna and the later Arabian authors, with
Theodoric, Lanfranc, and other European writers of the middle
ages, express a similar belief in the hereditary transmission of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>disease; and in the same spirit, our countryman Gilbert, writing,
as we have already seen, in the thirteenth century, observes, &#8220;Lepra
est interdum morbus primus, sicut ex spermatibus primis matris et
patris Leprosis. Sanguis enim corruptus interius, qui est nutrimentum
foetus, corrumpit foetum.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></p>

<p>Amid the scattered fragments relative to the former history of
leprosy in this country, it can scarcely be expected that we should
have preserved for us any individual data bearing directly upon
the transmission of the disease from father to son. I have met,
however, with one notice, which, though imperfect, it may not be
considered uninteresting to quote in regard to the present question.
In the Burgh Records of Glasgow for 1581, Patrick Bogle is
ordered to be inspected for leprosy;<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> and eight years afterwards
(1589) &#8220;Robert Bogill, <i>sone</i> to Patrick Bogle,&#8221; is reported as an
inmate of the leper-house belonging to the city.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></p>

<p>It is unnecessary to adduce the opinions of modern authors in
support of the occasional hereditary transmission of leprosy, as all
observers who have described the disease from their own observations,
and that in the most different and distant parts of the world,
seem uniformly agreed upon this point. Dr. Heineken, in his
account of the inmates of the leper hospital at Funchal, Madeira,
in 1825,<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> states that in three of the cases no hereditary taint was
known; the aunt of a fourth (p. 21) was a lazar; the uncle and
two brothers of a fifth (p. 18) laboured under the same disease;
the mother, brother, and son of a sixth (p. 19), were lepers, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>all of them affected before himself; and in a seventh case (a female
aged 35) her father, mother, three sisters, and two brothers, had
already all died of elephantiasis.</p>

<p>Among the seven cases of elephantiasis seen by Dr. Kinnis in
the Mauritius,<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> three were Mozambique slaves, and could give no
satisfactory account of their parentage. Of the remaining four&mdash;the
first could give no history of her father and mother, but
had brothers and sisters in perfect health: the ancestors of the
second patient had not been affected with leprosy, but her husband
had laboured under it for two years before death: the third case
was a daughter of these parents, and one of her brothers had died of
elephantiasis: the fourth patient appeared to have inherited the
predisposition from the family of his maternal grandmother, who
was never attacked herself, but who lost two sisters and three nieces
by the disease.</p>

<p>These and other similar data show that the predisposition to
leprosy, like the predisposition to other hereditary diseases, may
occasionally show itself only in one or two individual members of
a family; and may sometimes lie dormant for one or two generations,
to reappear in a subsequent one. &#8220;God and Nature,&#8221; says
the reverend author of a description of the Faroe Isles, formerly
quoted, &#8220;deals wonderfully with such people (lepers) in their marriages,
for amongst the children, they beget some clean and some
unclean. It has also been taken notice of that two living together
in marriage, though the one be found infected, they live
together as before, as long as one doth but murmur of it, till the
magistrate doth separate them, and yet the sound remaineth unin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>fected;
whereas another is often taken with the disease by a very
little conversation.... What is this? but that God confirms the
truth of his word, taking pleasure in them that live in a just wedlock,
and wander in lawful ways, putting their hopes in him, that
neither fire nor water, contagious disease, nor dangerous pestilence
shall hurt them.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></p>

<p>In some of the few districts of Europe in which cases of the
disease have continued to linger down to a late period, the malady
seems to be transmitted through an old hereditary taint in particular
families, rather than generated by existing external circumstances
acting on the bodies of those who now become its victims.
The tubercular leprosy exists still, or at least existed lately, in
the districts of Martigues and Vitrolles<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> in the south of France.
The cases, though very few, have still been well marked. M. Vidal,
who, towards the end of last century, described several instances
of the disease which he saw at Martigues, states that, with one
problematical exception, the malady was in every case hereditary.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a>
&#8220;May we not,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;conclude from this, that if the local
causes which are generally assigned for leprosy be true, they have
not, at least in our country, sufficient power to originate the disease
(la faire na&icirc;tre), but generally only to develope and perpetuate
it in the descendants of ancient lepers?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> The same family predisposition
probably perpetuated the malady for some generations in
the few cases that occurred in Shetland, in the latter part of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>last century. The case of the Shetlander Berns, as mentioned in a
preceding Part, was an instance in which the disease was apparently
the result of hereditary transmission from his ancestry.</p>

<p class="tb">The predisposition from hereditary constitution to leprosy, and
some other diseases, was well known to our forefathers; and, if
we place credit in the account of the &#8220;auld manneris&#8221; of the Scotch
antecedently to the reign of Malcolm Canmore, as &#8220;compilit be the
nobil clerke, Maister Hector Bo&euml;ce, Channon of Aberdene,&#8221; they
were accustomed to practise hygienic measures that were assuredly
more summary than humane, in order to arrest the diffusion of disease
by such channels. For, to quote the words of Bo&euml;ce:&mdash;&#8220;He that
was trublit with the falling evil (epilepsy), or fallin daft or wod
(insane), or having sic infirmitie as succedis be <i>heritage</i> fra the fader
to the son, was geldit (<i>castratus</i>), that his infekit blude suld spreid
na forthir. The women that was fallin <i>Lipper</i>, or had any other
infection of blude, was banist fra the cumpany of men, and gif scho
consavit barne under sic infirmitie, baith scho and hir barne war
buryit quik (if she conceived a child under such infirmity, both she
and her child were buried alive&#8221;).<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">External exciting causes of Leprosy in the Middle Ages.</span></p>

<p>The investigation of the causes of diseases has, probably more
than any other department of medicine, been marked by belief
without evidence, and assertion without facts. The history of the
opinions which have at different times been so freely offered and
adopted with regard to the production of leprosy, and the numerous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>explanations which have been proposed with respect to the causes
of its almost epidemic prevalence in Europe in the middle ages,
and its nearly complete suspension in the same region of the world
at the present day, might easily, if time and space permitted, be
made to form a chapter highly illustrative of the above general
remark. The frequency of the disease in former times has been
confidently ascribed by different authors<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> to peculiarities in the
diet, dress, personal and domestic habits, etc., of our forefathers.
And certainly their mode of life was in many respects specially
calculated to generate derangements and eruptions of the skin.
The good old Saxon practice of bathing<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> appears to have become
forgotten after the date of the Norman conquest; and in the subsequent
history of these early times we might trace various indirect
and direct causes of cutaneous disease, in the close hovels and unventilated
dwellings of the period;<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> in the habits of personal unclean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>ness;<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a>
in the rough straw bedding then generally<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> in use, and which
&#8220;hard lodging&#8221; Hollinshed describes as still used by the servants
in his day, &#8220;with seldome (he adds) anie sheete vnder their bodies
to keepe them from the pricking straws that run oft through the
canvas, and rase their hardened hides;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> and probably also in the
articles of diet<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> on which the general community were obliged to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>subsist in times before the improvement of agriculture, and the
introduction of that &#8220;schamefull intemperance&#8221; (as old Boece<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a>
fanatically terms it), &#8220;when na fische in the see, nor foule in the
aire, nor beast in the wod may have rest, but are socht heir and
thair to satisfy the hungry appetit.&#8221; For the investigation of this
and other allied questions in the history of the production of our
older epidemic and endemic diseases, the works of Hollinshed,
Strutt, Henry, Chalmers, Macpherson, and others, contain a great
and available mass of materials. But, in consequence of the unforeseen
extent to which our present remarks have already lengthened
out, we are forced to abstain from entering into this topic, and discussing
the notes which we have collected in regard to it. At the
same time, however, we may pause to observe that we believe it
would be no easy matter to point out the exact differences in those
physical conditions of the inhabitants of this country in former and
in modern times, which may have led to the prevalence of the disease
amongst our ancestors, and to its disappearance amongst us.
If poverty in diet, or personal wants, and filth, and wretchedness in
their deepest degrees, could generate the malady, there are certainly
still numerous spots in continental Europe, and even in our own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>land, where, unfortunately, all these elements of disease are in our
own day in full and active operation, without any such specific result
following; the alleged causes are present without the alleged effects.</p>

<p class="tb">In order to attain anything like satisfactory results of the supposed
physical causes of leprosy in Great Britain in former times,
the whole question would require to be thoroughly investigated in
connection with two others, viz., the allied physical circumstances,&mdash;<i>firstly</i>,
of the inhabitants of those countries in which the disease
in the same way formerly raged; and, <i>secondly</i>, of those districts
of the world in which it is still prevalent. It is only by following
such a line of inquiry that we could hope, if at all, to separate
mere matters of opinion from matters of fact, and at last to obtain,
by a kind of reasoning by exclusion, the exact physical condition
or conditions of a people that are capable of originating or of
spreading this particular species of disease. The difficulty of the
problem may be easily appreciated by glancing for a moment at the
diversified <i>geographical localities</i> and circumstances under which
the tubercular leprosy is known at the present day to appear. In
modern times it has been found existing, to a more or less limited
extent, in places the most distant and the most dissimilar in regard
to temperature, climate, situation, soil, etc., as in Sumatra,<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> under
the equator, and in parts of Iceland almost within the verge of the
Arctic Circle;<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> in the temperate regions of both hemispheres, as

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Contagion as a Cause of Leprosy.</span></p>

<p>Most modern pathologists seem inclined to call in question the
contagious nature of tubercular leprosy, as it at present exists in
different parts of the globe.</p>

<p>Cullen, Darwin, and Good are almost the only English physicians
of later times that have admitted the contagious character of the
disease, and that not from personal observation. The evidence
bearing against the doctrine of this mode of its diffusion is principally
of a simply negative kind. In some of the districts in which the
malady is endemic, the sick are seen to maintain a free intercourse
with the healthy, without the disease being frequently or at all communicated
to the latter; the nurses of the lazar hospitals are alleged
to remain uninfected; lepers often continue long in the midst of
their families without spreading the scourge to any of the other
members; and occasionally a husband and wife are seen living in
wedlock for years, one of them deeply affected by the disease, and
the other remaining perfectly sound. Instances, exceptional to
these general remarks, are certainly occasionally observed, as in a
case quoted in a previous page from Dr. Kinnis, of a wife becoming
infected subsequently to both her husband and daughter suffering
from an attack of the malady. In such cases as this, however, we
must recollect that the repetition of the disease in two or more
members of the same family may merely depend upon the same
external or general morbific agencies, acting upon the constitution
of all the sufferers.</p>

<p>At least, whenever, from circumstances, this source of fallacy is
avoided, the evidence of the contagion of leprosy seems to become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
more and more defective. Thus, when the disease happens to be
imported in the person of an infected individual from a district in
which it is endemic, to one in which it is unknown, the malady
seems to have no tendency whatever at the present day to spread
to any of the inhabitants of the new and healthy locality. Persons
labouring under tubercular leprosy are occasionally, for example,
sent from southern stations to England and France. In such not
unfrequent cases the malady has never, I believe, been known to
be communicated, in one single instance, from the infected person
to those resident inhabitants of the new district, among whom he
was living in free and daily intercourse.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></p>

<p>Did the leprosy extend and prevail over Europe in the middle
ages as independently of propagation by contagion as the perpetuation
of the disease seems to be in most localities at the present day?</p>

<p>If we deferred to the mere opinion of the older medical and
historical authors, the contagious character of the disease at that
era would appear to be undoubted. These authors express an
unanimous opinion on its contagious propagation; and it is not
till we come down to the professional writers of the seventeenth
century, as Fernelius<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> and Forestus,<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> that we find this doctrine
ventured to be called in question.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p><p>The evidence, however, left us by the older authorities and
physicians on this point, is an evidence of opinion rather than of
facts. They have bequeathed to us merely their own dogmatic
inferences, without vouchsafing to state any of the individual data
upon which their general deductions were founded. As far, however,
as we may judge by a few loose fragments which we may still
gather up from amid the imperfect and scattered records of the
disease, the European leprosy, if it were contagious, when epidemic
in the middle ages, was at least less so than the combined medical
and popular belief of those times would seem to represent it. In
the Edinburgh hospital in 1590, two of the lepers&#8217; wives lived uninfected
with their husbands; and a few of the English leper hospitals,
as those of Ripon, St.&nbsp;Magdalene, Exeter, and St.&nbsp;Bartholomew,
near Oxford, were endowed for the purpose of serving as retreats
at one and the same time both for the merely poor and the truly
leprous.</p>

<p>Individuals stricken with leprosy were sometimes looked upon
by the superstitious spirit of the age as persons directly smitten by
the hand of God; and we find in history traces of rich and noble,
and even of royal devotees, endeavouring to expiate their sins and
propitiate the good will of Heaven, by occasionally devoting themselves,
and that with perfect impunity, to such duties to the sick as
offered the most certain means of calling down the disease upon
their own bodies, provided it had been at all so contagious as was
generally supposed. Saint Louis (Louis IX.) of France visited the
leper hospitals every third month, personally rendered the most
abject services to their inmates, fed them, and bathed their sores<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
with his own hands.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> Henry III. of England is reported to have
annually, on Shrove Tuesday, engaged in the same duties.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> Robert
II., the son of Hugh Capet, enacted the devotee in the same manner,
imprinting kisses with his lips on the hands of the lepers (<i>ore proprio
figens leprosorum manibus oscula, in omnibus Deum collaudabat</i>).<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a>
The old English historian, Matthew Paris, relates, in his usual
quaint and gossiping style, an anecdote illustrative of a similar
degree of charitable penance and defiance of contagion being
practised by the Scottish Princess Matilda, the queen of Henry I.
of England. Speaking of some transactions in the year 1105, he
observes&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the same time David (King of Scotland), the brother of
Matilda, Queen of the English, came to England to visit his sister,
and when, on a certain evening, he came by her invitation to her
chamber, he found the house filled with lepers (<i>domum invenit
Leprosis plenam</i>), and the Queen standing in the midst, having laid
aside her cloak, she with both hands girded herself with a towel,
and water being placed in readiness, she began to wash their feet,
and wipe them with the towel, and embracing them with both
hands, kissed them with the utmost devotion. Upon which her
brother addressed her thus; &#8216;What is this which you are doing, my
Lady? in truth if the King knew this, he would never deign to kiss
with his lips your mouth, contaminated by the pollution of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>lepers&#8217; feet!&#8217; and she, smiling, replied, &#8216;Who knows not that the feet
of an Eternal King are to be preferred to the lips of an earthly king?
Behold it was for this that I invited you, dearest brother&mdash;that you
might learn by my example to perform similar actions. Do, I
beseech you, that which you see me doing.&#8217; And when her brother
had made answer that he would by no means do such things, as
she persevered in her employment David with a smile withdrew.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></p>

<p>In quoting, against the alleged strong contagion of the olden
leprosy, the preceding instances of complete exposure to the infection
of the disease, and yet, at the same time, of complete escape
from it in some well-known historical personages, let it not be
inferred that the victims of the malady were usually looked upon
by the general community with feelings of devotion and pious
commiseration. On the contrary, the subjects of this &#8220;<i>foedissimus
omnium morborum</i>&#8221; were, as a body, regarded alike by the church
and by the people as objects of disgust. The Council of Ancyrus
decreed that lepers were only to be allowed to worship amongst the
Hyemantes, or those public penitents who, on account of the enormity
and turpitude of some of their sins, were obliged to stand in the
open air, and not even allowed to come under the porch of the
church.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> The Council of Worms granted to lepers a liberty of
receiving the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, but
not with those in perfect health.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> Guido de Monte Rocher, in his
<i>Manual for Curates</i>, states, that to some lepers the sacrament
cannot be given, because &#8220;non possunt corpus Dominicum sic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>recipere et tractare in ore suo, quin rejicerent ipsum, sic multi,
quibus reciderunt labia et dentes et sunt totaliter corrosi usque ad
guttur.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></p>

<p>The preamble to the laws of the hospital of St.&nbsp;Julian&#8217;s, drawn
up by Abbot Michael, asserts, that &#8220;amongst all infirmities the
disease of leprosy may be considered the most loathsome, and
those who are smitten with it ought at all times, and in all places,
and as well in their conduct as in their dress, to bear themselves as
more to be despised and as more humble than all other men.&#8221; The
canons of the Church of Scotland, as drawn up in the thirteenth
century, deal with the unfortunate lepers more humanely than
most other ecclesiastical judicatories; for after recommending them
to be admonished to respect the churches of their districts, it is
added that, if they cannot be induced to do so, let no coercion be
employed, seeing that affliction should not be accumulated upon the
afflicted, but rather their miseries commiserated (<i>cum afflictis addi
non debeat afflictio, sed ipsorum, miseriis sit potius miserandum</i>.)<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a>
But the contempt displayed towards them seems to have been
almost proverbial as late as the age of Elizabeth. Thus Shakespeare
makes Margaret of Anjou exclaim to the afflicted and suspicious
Henry VI., after the murder of his uncle, the Duke of Gloucester,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line">Why dost thou turn away and hide thy face?</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Maundrell, one of our early English travellers in Palestine,
alludes to some cases of leprosy in terms portraying simply but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>strongly the fearful effects and character of the disease. After
speaking of some cases of leprosy that he met with in his journey,
he states (to quote his own words), &#8220;At Sichem, near Naplous,
there were not less than ten lepers,&mdash;the same number that was
cleansed by our Saviour not far from the same place, that came
a-begging to us at one time. Their manner is to come with small
buckets in their hands to receive the alms of the charitable, their
touch being still held infectious, or at least unclean. Their whole
distemper was so noisome that it might (he adds) well pass for
the utmost corruption of the human body on this side the grave.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></p>

<p>Various authors have alleged that the institution of leper hospitals,
and laws for the separation and seclusion of the infected,
were formed more from imitation of the Levitical institutions
regarding the leprosy than from direct observation and proofs of
the contagious character of the disease. The avoidance, however,
and separation of the sick, have been recommended and followed
by authors and by communities over whom the Levitical laws
could have exercised no influence, direct or indirect, and to whom,
indeed, these laws were in all probability totally unknown.</p>

<p>After describing the horrors and course of elephantiasis or
tubercular leprosy, the old Roman physician, Aret&aelig;us, adds,
&#8220;seeing the infected with this disease are such, who would not fly
them? (<i>aufugiat</i>), or who would not turn aside from a leper, even
although he were a son, or a father, or a brother, since there is fear
lest the disease should be communicated? (<i>quum metus est ne morbus</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span><i>communicaretur</i>). Hence, many have banished those that were
dearest to them into solitudes and mountains.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<p>A knowledge of the laws and customs of the Jews in all probability
never reached, or at least certainly never influenced, the
opinions of the inhabitants of Tonquin&mdash;a kingdom which was
formerly a part, and long a tributary, of China, and where the
general religion is the idolatry of Fo and of Lanzo, with sects of
the literati or followers of Confucius;<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> yet in that country those
infected with leprosy are treated on the same principles of separation
from the general community as we find applied to them in
other and distant districts. &#8220;In Tonquin, leprosy is so common,&#8221;
says Richard in his history of that country, &#8220;that there are pieces
of land assigned where those attacked by it must reside. They are
shut out from society; and it is even lawful to kill them if they
enter cities or towns.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> In a country like Tonquin, it is difficult to
conceive how laws and usages of this kind could have originated in
anything except a belief in the contagious nature of the disease, as
derived from the observation of its mode of diffusion. At all events,
the old institutions and customs of the different kingdoms of
Europe, in regard to lepers, seem all to have been originally founded
on such a belief in the possibility of the contagious communication
of this dreadful and dreaded disease from the sick to the healthy.
These institutions and customs I propose now to sketch very briefly,
and that principally as they bear upon the usages formerly observed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>towards lepers in England and Scotland. I shall consider them
as they refer to&mdash;1. The separation of the infected from the general
intercourse of society; 2. The laws prohibiting their entrance into
towns; and 3. The restrictions under which they were placed as
inmates of the hospitals.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Separation of Lepers from the General and Healthy
Community.</span></p>

<p>After all that I have already had occasion to state relative to
the objects of the leper hospitals, and the selection of the infected,
it is almost unnecessary to add that in Great Britain, as upon the
Continent,<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> lepers were obliged, either by law or usage, to seclude
themselves from society when once the disease was discovered upon
their persons.</p>

<p>The chancery warrant of Edward IV., quoted in the Second Part
of these papers, speaks of the retirement of a leper from society as
a matter of custom and duty, and empowers the sheriff of the
county to remove the suspected person to a secluded place, as is
the usage (<i>prout moris est</i>), provided the actual existence of the
disease was made out.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p><p>There exist in the old records of Scotland both local and
general enactments enforcing the retirement and seclusion of
lepers. The Scottish &#8220;Burrow Lawes&#8221; (<i>Leges Burgorum</i>) are generally
allowed to have been drawn up as early as the twelfth century.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a>
They are a code intended apparently for the government
of the four first royal burghs of Scotland, viz. Berwick, Roxburgh,
Edinburgh, and Stirling. Their sixty-fourth chapter contains some
regulations regarding &#8220;lippermen.&#8221; The first of these regulations
provides in the following terms for the lodgment in hospital and
sustenance of the &#8220;lippermen&#8221; of the burghs:<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gif ony man dwelland or borne in the King&#8217;s Burgh is striken
with leprosie, and hes substance and geir of his awin to sustaine
and cleath himselfe, he sall be put in the hospitall of that burgh
quhere he dwells. And gif he hes na thing to liue upon, the burgesses
of that burgh sall make ane collection amongst them, for
meat and claith to him; and that collection sall be the summe
of twentie shillinges.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>The canons of the Church of Scotland, as drawn up or authorised
by the provincial ecclesiastical councils held at Perth in the
years 1242 and 1269, speak of those attacked by leprosy in this
country, as being &#8220;separated from society in accordance with
general custom (<i>de consuetudine generali a communione hominum
separantur</i>) and retired to secluded situations.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a></p>

<p class="tb">I have already, in Part II., quoted a clause from the acts of the
Perth Parliament of 1427, empowering and enforcing the dignitaries
and officers of the church to search diligently in their parish
visitations for any persons affected with leprosy, and to commit
them to the keeping of either the civil or ecclesiastical authorities,
according as they happened to be &#8220;Clerkes&#8221; or &#8220;Seculars.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Prohibitions against the Infected entering Towns.</span></p>

<p>Lepers were compelled, by other reasons than mere custom or
common law, to retire from society. They were of necessity driven
to seek the asylum of the lazar hospitals, in consequence of the
statutes, both of the general country and of local communities, prohibiting
any citizen from retaining a person labouring under leprosy
in his house, and preventing the infected from entering within the
gates of the towns and villages.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p><p>The old Scottish Burrow Lawes have stringent clauses upon this
head, for they hold that &#8220;na man should presume, or be so bauld
as to harberie or ludge ane lipperman within the burgh, under ane
full amerciament.&#8221; And further, &#8220;lippermen sall not enter within
the towne, bot in passing throw it, and sall not gang fra dure to dure,
but sall sit at the ports of the burgh, and sall seek almes fra them
that passes in and comes furth.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></p>

<p>By the later general act of the Perth Parliament, the unfortunate
beings affected with the disease were again prohibited from entering
towns except for the purpose of purchasing victuals, and this
they were only allowed to do on three days of the week, the act
strictly providing that&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Item</i>, Na lipper folke, nouther man nor woman, enter nor cum in
ane Burgh of the Realme but thrise in the oulk (week) that is to saie,
Mondaie, Wednesdaie, and Fridaie, fra ten hours to twa after noone;
and quhair faires and mercattis fallis on thay dayis, that they leave
their entrie in the Burrowes, and gang on the morne to get their living.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></p>

<p>Various towns and local judicatories in the country seem to
have at different times passed laws enforcing more strictly the
observance of exclusion of the infected from their own limits and
districts. Some of these local enactments have been preserved;
and I shall quote such as I have been able to discover, with a view
to show the general fear formerly entertained of the contagion of
the disease, and the measures that were adopted to prevent its
communication.</p>

<p>Thus, in the statutes of the Society of Merchants or Guildry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>of Berwick-upon-Tweed, said to have been drawn up by the mayor
and others in &#8220;the Zeare of God 1283-84,&#8221; it is strictly provided
that &#8220;Na lipper man sall enter within the portes of our burgh; and
gif any by chance enters within them, he sall be incontinent put
forth be the sergant of the burgh. And gif any lipper man uses
commonlie contrair this our discharge, to come within our burgh,
his claithes wherewith he is cled sall be taken from him and sall
be brunt, and he being naked sall be ejected furth of the burgh.
Because it is provyded be the common councill, that some gude
man sall gather almes to them, that they may be sustained in ane
place competent for them without the burgh. And this is to be
understand of lipper folk, indwellers within the burgh, and not of
them quha dwells without the burgh.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></p>

<p>Some of the smaller burghs and villages of these early times
had their individual rules and statutes upon the same point. The
burgh of Prestwick, Ayrshire, which contains at present, and probably
never contained more than about 1000 inhabitants, is situated
about half-a-mile north of the leper hospital of Kingcase. The
old official records and statutes of this small burgh, to which
reference has repeatedly been made in the preceding pages, have
lately been printed from the original MS. by Mr. Smith of Swinridgemuir.
The earliest burgh record that has thus been preserved
is a collection of the laws of the burgh, &#8220;Statuta Burgi de Prestwick
maide by the haile consent of the community of the same at the
Cross of the same burgh, and to be keepit and rafit unremittable and
unrevocable.&#8221; The date of this collection, or probably re-collection
of the burgh laws, is 1470. The fourth of the statutes fixed upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>&#8220;for the common profit of the said burgh in time coming for everlasting
memorans&#8221; is to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is statut yat na man inhabitant ye said burghe or weman
commoun or intromet with ye sic folk (commune or intromit with
the sick people) of Kingcase, vnder ye pain of exiling ye said
burghe when thai ar ourtane (overtaken) be ane enquest yairupon,
mair plainli yan ony oyder persounis or persoun duelland in all ye
land about.&#8221;&mdash;P. 15.</p>

<p>In the minuted records of the burgh, different cases occur of
persons accused in accordance with this statute. Thus, on December
1, 1477, Anne Kerd and Andro Sauer are accused of repairing to
Kingcase.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> On the 26th April of the second following year, 1479,
it was alleged with regard to the said Andro Sauer, that he &#8220;repairis
till Kingcase daily and nigtly and his wif and his bairnis.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> This
Anne Kerd seems to have had the property of a burgess. At last,
in November 1481, the same rebellious Prestwickian, &#8220;Andro
Sauer, is fund in daili reparand to Kingcase, and yis the xxti court
yerein, and is abill till infect ye hale toune; and weris ye seik
folkis clathis and bonnettis.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> After this date no more mention is
made in the records of Andro, who repeatedly figures in them
previously, for other more serious deeds than that of repairing to
Kingcase. I find, however, that others of his name, and probably
of his kindred, fall into the same error for which he himself appears
to have been banished. Thus, in 1496, Anne Sauer, Marion Myllar,
Ellane Browne, and Anne Duncane, &#8220;are ilkane severale in amerciamentis
for the selling of ale and intromettin of the folkis of Kingcase
again the statutis of the towne.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p><p>Few or none of the very early records and laws of the magistrates
of Edinburgh have been preserved, but amidst some lately
recovered, of a date as late as 1530, we find the following statute
anent the &#8220;Leper Folke,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;It is statut and ordanit be the Provost,

<p>Some of the old edicts and regulations made in regard to the
diseased in London have been preserved for us by Stow. According
to the record of Edward III., that king sent, in 1346, &#8220;a commandment
under his Great Seal, to the mayor and sheriffs of London,
willing them to make proclamation in every ward of the city and
suburbs, that all leprous persons within the said city and suburbs
should avoid within fifteen days, and that no man suffer any such
leprous person to abide within his house, upon pain to forfeit his
said house, and to incur the king&#8217;s further displeasure. And that
they should cause the said lepers to be removed into some out
places of the Fields, from the haunt and company of all sound
people.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> From some of the city records it further appears that
the magistrates ordered &#8220;That the lepers walk not about the streets,
nor tarry there; that the keepers of the gates swear that they will
not permit lepers to enter into the city.&#8221; &#8220;There was at one time,&#8221;
adds Stow, &#8220;a brief for removing them from the city and suburbs.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>At another time there was an edict for levying a hundred shillings
out of a tenement of the lepers, and delivering it to their officers
for sustaining them.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Restrictions placed upon the Inmates of the Leper
Hospitals.</span></p>

<p>The chance of contagion was provided against by other means
besides the mere separation of the infected from the community,
and their banishment to the lazar hospitals. In many instances
the regulations and statutes to which the lepers were subjected, as
inmates of these hospitals, were strongly restrictive, and framed with
a view of preventing them from spreading the disease to others by
any dangerous degree of personal communication with the healthy.
The occasional severity of the restrictions to which, with this view,
the leper inhabitants of the hospitals were subjected, affords us a
curious example both of the great dread in which the disease was
held, and of the extent and stringency of the measures of medical
police which the local judicatories of this country had in these
times both the power and the will to exercise.</p>

<p>The rules of the Greenside Hospital, Edinburgh, present in
themselves a striking proof of this, and the occupants of the hospital
were bound to observe these rules under the penalty of death.
&#8220;That this,&#8221; observes Arnott, &#8220;might not be deemed an empty
threatening, a gallows was erected at the gavel of the hospital for
the immediate execution of offenders.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></p>

<p>The persons placed in the Greenside Hospital in 1591 were
five male lepers with two of their wives&mdash;viz. (to quote the record)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>&#8220;Robert Mardow, James Garvie, Johnn MacRere, James Wricht,
and Johnn Wilderspune, lepperis, togidder with Isobel Barcar,
spous to the said Robert Mardow, and Janet Galt, spous to the said
James Garvie.&#8221; Among other regulations enacted in regard to them,
it was specially ordained, &#8220;That nane of the said personis Lepperis,
or their wyffes, depart or resort fra the said hospitall to na oyder

thairof, and for terrefying the said lepperis to transgress the samyn,
the said commissioners has thocht meitt and expedient that there

Sessioun of this burgh, <i>ad perpetuam rei memoriam</i>.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></p>

<p>The tenor of the regulations of the British leper hospitals was
probably in few or no other cases so extremely stringent as in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>establishment at Greenside. At least, if we may judge by the
records of most of those hospitals, the rules of which have been
accidentally preserved, the restrictions placed upon the inmates
were confessedly great, but certainly by no means so severe either
in their degree or in the punishment applied to them, as in those
which we have just cited. Besides, in most institutions, the prior,
master, or warden of the hospital, exercised a discretionary power
in relation to the degree of seclusion of the lepers of their establishment.</p>

<p>Thus, among the rules of the leper hospital of St.&nbsp;Magdalene,
Exeter, it was provided that &#8220;no brother or sister shall go or pass
out of the house beyond the bridge, without the gate of the said
hospital, without the license of the Warden or his deputy, upon
pain to be put into the stocks, and to have but bread and water for
one day.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></p>

<p>Again, among the many rules enacted by the Abbot Michaele
for the regulation of the hospital of St.&nbsp;Julian, in the neighbourhood
of St.&nbsp;Albans, I may select the following as characteristic
illustrations of the point which we are now considering:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let no one presume to transgress the bounds fixed of old,
(<i>metas ab antiquo statutas</i>), of which one is placed in the south,
another in the north, as they still remain in view, except the custor
of granges and granaries, to whom the charge is committed to the
master.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Let no brother venture to enter the bake-house or brew-house
in any manner, with the exception of the brother to whom the
charge is assigned, who, when he enters, may not approach the bread
and beer, in touching or handling them in any way; since it is not
meet that men of such infirmity should handle those things which
are appointed for the common use of men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let no one of the brothers attempt to go beyond the bounds of
the hospital, namely, in the direction of the king&#8217;s road, without
his close cape, in going to church or returning, nor stand or walk
about in the said street before or after service (nor, indeed, at
any hour of the day before or after dinner); but when divine service
is finished, let them enter their hospitals with all haste, unless any
one wishes to remain in the church, that he may have leisure for
prayer and meditation. In like manner, we command that there
be no standing in the corridor, which extends in length before the
houses of the brothers in the direction of the king&#8217;s road; and that
no brother hold conversation there (<i>teneat ibi parliamentum</i>) with
another; but if any brother wish to hold colloquy with another, let
one go to the other in order, as he may wish, through the said
corridor, without standing by the way, unless some stranger chance
to meet him, with whom he may briefly speak and pass on. But
if an honest man and true come there, for the purpose of visiting
an infirm brother, let him have access to him, that they may
mutually discourse on that which is meet.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></p>

<p>In considering under a previous head the extent of endowment
of the British leper hospitals, we have seen that the inmates of
many of the poorer institutions depended more or less entirely for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>their means of subsistence upon the casual alms which they were
able to beg from the charitable. In a few favoured cases the lepers
were specially authorised to pursue this occupation beyond the
district of the hospital. A charter was given by King John to the
lepers of St.&nbsp;Lawrence&#8217;s Hospital, Bristol, granting them great privileges
of this kind. Some of the passages in this charter are curious,
as illustrative of the present point. I append a translation of a
part of it from the copy of the original document as published by
Dugdale:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;John, by the grace of God, King of England, etc., to the Archbishops,
etc., greeting, know ye that we, for the love of God, have
granted, and by this charter have confirmed to the lepers near Bristol,
a croft beyond the gate of Lacford, on the road to Bath, to dwell
there, as the charter which we gave them while we were Count
Moreton reasonably proves; know ye also that we have received
these lepers into our protection, and therefore desire and command
that ye befriend and protect them (<i>quod eos manu teneatis et protegatis</i>),
and cause no impediment to them, wherever they shall be
asking alms in our lands, as our letters-patent which we granted
unto them when Count Moreton rationally testifies,&#8221; etc.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></p>

<p>Grants and liberties, such as the above, were certainly, however,
rare. In general the lepers were restricted as to the districts and
places in which they presented themselves to seek for alms. We
have already seen the Burrow Lawes ordering that they &#8220;sall not
gang fra dure to dure, but sall sit at the ports of the burgh, and
seek alms fra them that passes in and furth;&#8221; and the Scottish
Parliament of 1427 enacted that they should not be allowed to sit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>and beg &#8220;neither in kirk nor in kirk-yairdis,<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> nor other places
within the burrowes, but at their owne hospital, and at the part of
the town and other places outwith the burrowes.&#8221; But even in
exercising this vocation in these stated places, the unfortunate
petitioners seem to have been everywhere obliged to use certain
precautions, with the view of prohibiting them from diffusing the
disease.</p>

<p>In Scotland, and in various other parts of Europe, they were
obliged, for this purpose, to use a &#8220;clapper&#8221; or rattle, in order that
the noise created by it might warn the healthy of the presence of
an infected fellow-mortal, whilst, at the same time, they carried a
&#8220;cop&#8221; or receiving dish, into which the charitable might drop their
alms.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> Muratori tells us that in Italy the lepers made their presence
known at a great distance (<i>longe positos</i>) by the noise of a
certain piece of wood. Marmotrecti describes more minutely the
instrument as composed of wood, and formed of two or three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>tablets of it, which the leper struck together when seeking bread
(<i>quas concutit leprosus quaerendo panem</i>).<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></p>

<p>In the celebrated old Scoto-Saxon poem of Sir Tristrem, composed
probably about the middle of the thirteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> and
valuable (to use the words of an acute critic)<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> &#8220;for its pictures of
ancient manners&#8221; and the customs &#8220;of Scotland in the days of
Alexander III.,&#8221; the hero of the romance is, at one stage of his
adventures in Cornwall, represented as assuming for disguise and
concealment the appearance of a leper or mesel.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> In this character
the poet provides him with the usual cop and clapper (stanza
80, p. 181).</p>

<p>And from the advice proffered by the other lepers to the weeping

<p>Into some towns the lepers seem to have been allowed the
liberty of entry, provided they used their clappers, to advertise the
passing inhabitants of their presence, and thus allowed them to
shun the supposed danger of their contact. The magistrates of
Glasgow made the carrying of clappers one of the conditions on
which they admitted the occasional entrance of the inmates of the
Brigend hospital into their city, one of their edicts for October
1610 running thus:&mdash;&#8220;It is statut and ordanit that the Lipper of
the hospital sall gang (walk) only on the calsie (street) syde near
the gutter, and sall haif clapperis and ane claith upoun their mouth
and face, and sall stand afar of quhill they resaif almous, or answer
under the payne of banischeing them from the toun and hospital.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the statutes of the Greenside hospital, Edinburgh, was
to the effect&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;That nane of the lepperis cry or ask for alms, utherways then
be thair clapper; and that every ane of thame, his day about, sitt
at the dore of the said hospitall to that effect, the rest allwayes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>remaining within the samyn, and that thay distribute equallie

and gif the just declaration thairof to the visitour appoynted
everie Setterday, under sic payne as the counsill shall injoyne
unto thame.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Lepers regarded as Dead Persons by the Civil Law.</span></p>

<p>According to the tenor of various old civil codes and local
enactments, when a person became affected with leprosy he was
looked upon as legally and politically dead, and lost the privileges
belonging to his right of citizenship.</p>

<p>By the law of England lepers were classed with idiots, madmen,
outlaws, etc., as incapable of being heirs; and a leper removed by
a writ <i>de leproso amovendo</i> could not be a guardian in socage.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></p>

<p>Rotharis, king of Lombardy, as early as the eleventh century,
decreed that when any one became affected with leprosy, and the
fact was known to the judge or people, so that the leper was expelled
from society and dwelt in seclusion, he had no power to
alienate his effects or dispose of them to any one (<i>non sit illi
licentia res suas alienare aut thingare cuilibet person&aelig;</i>). For, it
is added, from the very day on which he is expelled from his home,
he is to be regarded as dead (<i>tanquam mortuus habetur</i>).<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> The
same was the law of Normandy, according to Dufresne<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>Delamarr&eacute;;<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> and Lobineau, in his history of Brittany,<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> speaks of it
being formerly in accordance with the rituals of various churches.</p>

<p>The leper was not looked upon in the eye of the law alone as
defunct, for the Church also took the same view, and performed
the solemn ceremonials of the burial of the dead over him on the
day on which he was separated from his fellow-creatures and consigned
to a lazar-house. He was from that moment regarded as
a man dead amongst the living, and legally buried, though still
breathing and alive. The ritual of the French church retained
till a late period the various forms and ceremonies to which the
leper was subjected on this day of his living funeral. Og&eacute;e<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> and
Pluquet<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> have both described them.</p>

<p class="tb">A priest robed with surplice and stole went with the cross to
the house of the doomed leper. The minister of the church began
the necessary ceremonies by exhorting him to suffer, with a patient
and penitent spirit, the incurable plague with which God had
stricken him. He then sprinkled the unfortunate leper with holy
water, and afterwards conducted him to the church, the usual
burial verses being sung during their march thither. In the church
the ordinary habiliments of the leper were removed; he was clothed
in a funeral pall; and while placed before the altar between two
trestles, the <i>Libera</i> was sung, and the mass for the dead celebrated
over him. After this service he was again sprinkled with holy
water, and led from the church to the house or hospital destined
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>for his future abode. A pair of clappers, a barell, a stick, cowl, and
dress, etc. etc., were given to him. Before leaving the leper, the
priest solemnly interdicted him from appearing in public without
his leper&#8217;s garb&mdash;from entering inns, churches, mills, and bake-houses&mdash;from
touching children, or giving them ought he had
touched&mdash;from washing his hands or anything pertaining to him in
the common fountains and streams&mdash;from touching in the markets
the goods he wished to buy with anything except his stick&mdash;from
eating or drinking with any others than lepers;&mdash;and he specially
forbade him from walking in narrow paths, or from answering those
who spoke to him in the roads and streets, unless in a whisper,
that they might not be annoyed with his pestilent breath and with
the infectious odour which exhaled from his body;&mdash;and last of all,
before taking his departure, and leaving the leper for ever to the
seclusion of the lazar-house, the official of the church terminated
the ceremony of his separation from his living fellow-creatures by
throwing upon the body of the poor outcast a shovelful of earth, in
imitation of the closure of the grave.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">List of Leper Hospitals in Great Britain.</span></p>

<p>In Part I. I enumerated specially the different Scottish leper
hospitals with which I was acquainted, and referred in general terms
to the number of similar institutions that had existed in England.
Under the idea that a connected view of all the British leper hospitals
might prove interesting, I have drawn out the following
alphabetical list of such of them as have come to my knowledge in
the course of the preceding inquiries. To the locality of each
hospital and its special designation, or rather dedication, I have
added the dates, as nearly as they could be ascertained, either of
its original foundation, or of the first notice of it to be found in
historical records. Among the unarranged mass of materials contained
in the <i>Notitia Monastica</i>, and in the <i>Monasticon Anglicanum</i>,
(to which works I am principally indebted for the notes of the
English leper houses), references exist to many old hospitals, the
individual objects of which are now utterly forgotten and unknown.
If sufficient records of them had been preserved we would probably
have been enabled to increase to a much greater extent the
subjoined list of institutions for lepers, as many of them, there is
little doubt, were set aside (like those we now enumerate) for the
reception of the victims of that disease, whose olden history, in as
far as relates to this country, we have so hastily and imperfectly
attempted to trace.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>

<p class="center3">ADDITIONAL NOTES BY JOSEPH ROBERTSON, LL.D.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Leper Hospital of Glasgow.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir James Simpson&#8217;s</span> Paper, Part I. p. 10.&mdash;&#8220;In 1350, in the reign of
David II., the Lady of Lochow, daughter of Robert, Duke of Albany,
erected a leper hospital at the Gorbals of Glasgow, near the old
bridge.&mdash;(Gibson&#8217;s <i>Hist. of Glasg.</i> p. 52; Cleland&#8217;s <i>Glasg.</i> vol. i. p. 68.)&#8221;</p>

<p>There is some mistake here. If the leper hospital was founded by
the Lady of Lochow, daughter of the Duke of Albany, it must have been
a hundred years after 1350. The dukedom of Albany was not created
until 1378, and the first daughter of that house who married a Knight
of Lochow was Marjory, the wife of Sir Duncan Campbell, who died in
1453.</p>

<p>The earliest record notice of the hospital which I have observed is
in 1494, when William Steward, prebendary of Killern and rector of
Glassfurd, endowed a chaplain to serve in the chapel of St.&nbsp;Ninian,
which he had lately built, &#8220;<i>ad Hospitale Leprosorum degentium prope
Pontem Glasguensem</i>.&#8221; He provided that yearly, on the anniversary of his
death, twenty-four poor scholars should assemble in the chapel of the
hospital to perform certain services, for which one penny was to be paid
to each of them, along with one shilling to the lepers&mdash;&#8220;et leprosis non
sociatis degentibus in dicto Hospitali xijd.&#8221; The lepers were to ring the
chapel bell for the <i>Salve Regina</i> every night, and to pray in the chapel
for their benefactors.&mdash;(<i>Regist. Episcopal. Glasg.</i>, vol. ii. pp. 488-490.
Edinb. 1843, Mait. Club.) In 1505 we have &#8220;pauperibus leprosis in
Leprosario Sancti Niniani trans pontem Glasguensem degentibus.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Liber
Collegii Nostre Domine Glasguensis</i>, p. 259. Glasg. 1846, Maitland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Club.) In 1528, James Houston, sub-dean of Glasgow, founder of the
Lady College (now the Tron Kirk) of Glasgow, ordered twelve pennies to
be distributed yearly, on the anniversary of his death, to the lepers beside
the Bridge of Glasgow, and others, who should appear in the churchyard
of the Lady College to say orisons for his soul&mdash;&#8220;<i>leprosis extraneis et
commorantibus juxta Pontem Glasguensem comparentibus in cimiterio prefecto
Ecclesie Collegiate oraturis Deum</i>.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Lib. Coll. Nostre Domine
Glasguensis</i>, p. 51.) The Tron Kirk or Ladye College was on the north
side of the Clyde, and within the burgh of Glasgow, so that we have here
proof that lepers in 1528 were not forbidden to enter the burgh. Contrast
this feeling towards them with the feeling shown in the Leges Burgorum
and Statuta Gilde of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, printed in
the <i>Acta Parliamentorum Scoti&aelig;</i>, vol. i., and with the banishment of all
lepers from Glasgow in 1593 and 1594, as instructed by the Kirk-Session
Records, abridged in Wodrow&#8217;s <i>Biograph. Collect.</i>, vol. ii. part ii. p. 41.</p>

<p>Did this difference of toleration arise from some corresponding difference
in the intensity or general diffusion of the disease?</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Leper Hospital at Stirling.</span></p>

<p>The existence of a leper-house at Stirling is proved by entries in the
Rotuli Scaccarii Regum Scotorum, MS. in the General Register House.</p>

<p class="tb">Observe how literally the situation of the leper-house, as described
in the language of record &#8220;<i>ad finem burgi</i>,&#8221; answers to Henryson&#8217;s

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Leper Hospital of Aberdeen.</span></p>

<p>The leper hospital of Aberdeen was in existence before 1363. A
charter of that year describes certain lands as bounded by the king&#8217;s
highway leading from the burgh of Aberdeen <i>versus domos Leprosorum</i>;
and again <i>a domibus dictorum Leprosorum</i>.&mdash;(<i>Registrum Episcopatus
Aberdonensis</i>, vol. ii. p. 283.)</p>

<p>The use of the plural <i>domos</i> and <i>domibus</i> may possibly denote that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
there were two hospitals, as at Canterbury and elsewhere&mdash;one for men
and one for women.</p>

<p>The Regent and the Privy Council interposed for the repair or
restoration of the leper hospital of Aberdeen in 1574; in 1578 it was
placed under the charge of a master; and in 1591 there were patients in
it.&mdash;(<i>Selections from Ecclesiastical Records of Aberdeen</i>, pp. 20, 23.
Aberd. 1846, Spald. Club.&mdash;<i>Extracts from the Burgh Records of Aberdeen</i>,
1570-1625, pp. 70, 71. Aberd. 1848, Spald. Club. <i>Book of Bon
Accord</i>, p. 342.) There would seem to have been an outbreak of leprosy
in Scotland about this time. It was in 1584 that the Magistrates of
Edinburgh issued orders for finding a commodious place for a leper-house;
in 1589 a leper-house was ordered to be built; and in 1591
there were five patients in it. (Sir James Simpson&#8217;s Paper, Part I. p. 11.)
So also in Glasgow, in 1586 the Kirk-Session of Glasgow gave orders that
&#8220;the Lepper Folk&#8217;s House or Spittal beyond the Bridge&#8221; should be
visited, &#8220;to see how the same should be reformed.&#8221; These orders were
renewed in 1587; in 1588 &#8220;the yard of the Lepper House&#8221; was built;
and in 1589 six lepers are found in the Hospital. (Wodrow&#8217;s <i>Biographical
Collections</i>, vol. ii. part ii. pp. 40, 41. Sir James Simpson&#8217;s Paper, Part I.
p. 10.) In 1593, &#8220;the Lepper House [of Glasgow] was charged to receive
none but townsfolks, and all Leppers were banished the town;&#8221; and in
1594 the Kirk-Session &#8220;beseeches the magistrates to put all Leppers out
of toun, for fear of infection.&#8221;&mdash;(Wodrow&#8217;s <i>Biographical Collections</i>, vol.
ii. part ii. pp. 40, 41.)</p>

<p>If there were really a new access of leprosy in Scotland about 1580-1590,
the disease seems speedily to have abated, at least in Aberdeen.
In 1604, when a female leper applied for admission, &#8220;the Keys of the
Hospital&#8221; were given to her, showing that the place was then empty and
locked up.&mdash;(<i>Selections from the Ecclesiastical Records of Aberdeen</i>, p. 34.)
In May 1610 it was ordered that two merks should be given by the
Kirk-Session &#8220;to the Lepper woman laitlie put in the Lepper Hous,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
becaus she will not gett any of the rent of the said Hous till Martenes
next;&#8221; denoting, apparently, that there was but one leper in the hospital
at this time.&mdash;(<i>Selections from the Ecclesiastical Records of Aberdeen</i>,
pp. 73, 74.) In 1612, a female leper, &#8220;being expellit furth of this
toun, as ane not meit to dwell within the same,&#8221; is allowed to take up
her abode in the leper-house, although &#8220;sche be not borne and bred
within this burght.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Extracts from the Burgh Records of Aberdeen</i>, vol.
ii. (1570-1625), p. 308.) I do not observe record of any later patient.
Fifty years afterwards, in 1661, both the leper hospital and its chapel
(erected in 1519) were ruined if not razed to the ground, &#8220;and scarcelie
is the name knowne to many.&#8221;&mdash;(Gordon&#8217;s <i>Description of Bothe Touns
of Aberdeene</i>, pp. 18, 19. Aberd. 1842, Spald. Club.)</p>

<p>Mr. Albert Way, in the <i>Promptorium Parvulorum</i>, p. 298, says&mdash;&#8220;Heutzner,
who visited England during the reign of Elizabeth, speaks of
the English as very subject to the disease of leprosy.&#8221; I have not
Heutzner&#8217;s book at hand, but it might be looked at to see if he speaks of
leprosy being prevalent in England so late as the reign of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Leper House of Rathven.</span></p>

<p>The date of the first charter now extant of the leper-house at Rothfan
(now Rathven) in the Enzie, was between the years 1224 and 1226,
as can be shown from the list of witnesses who attest it. It may be
remarked that the founder, John Bisset, is believed to have been a kinsman
of that Manaser Bisset, sewer to King Henry II. of England, who
founded the leper hospital of Mayden Bradley in Wilts, and whose wife
Alice, an heiress, is said to have been herself a leper.&mdash;(<i>Monasticon Anglicanum</i>,
vol. vi. part ii. p. 643, edit. ult.)</p>

<p>The hospital of Rathven still exists, but has long ceased to be occupied
by lepers. Its tenants, in 1563, were simply &#8220;beidmen,&#8221; and
their number had been reduced from seven to six. They had 42 marks
for their ordinary charges, and &pound;7 : 4s. for their habits. At the end of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
the last century every bedeman had half-an-acre of land for life, one boll
of oatmeal yearly, and 9s. 6d. also yearly. At that time none of the bedemen
lived in the hospital. But it was repaired not many years ago, and
when the <i>New Statistical Account of Scotland</i> was published, two of the
six bedemen resided in the hospital. It stands in the village of Rathven,
in the district of the Enzie, and the shire of Banff.&mdash;(<i>Antiquities of the
Shires of Aberdeen and Banff</i>, vol. ii. pp. 142-145. Aberd. 1847, Spald.
Club.)</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">The Knights of St.&nbsp;Lazarus in Scotland.</span></p>

<p>In 1296, Friar William Corbet, master of the house of St.&nbsp;Lazarus of
Harop (Frater Willelmus Corbet, magister domus Sancti Lazari de Harop),
had letters for the restitution of his lands, directed to the Sheriff of Edinburgh
(a sheriffdom which then included both Haddingtonshire and Linlithgowshire),
from King Edward I. of England, as overlord of Scotland.&mdash;(<i>Rotuli
Scoti&aelig;</i>, vol. i. p. 25. London, 1814.)</p>

<p>In 1376, King Robert II. granted a charter to his eldest son, John,
Earl of Carrick, Steward of Scotland, of the lands of Prestisfelde, St.
Giles&#8217; Grange, and Spetelton, in the sheriffdom of Edinburgh, then in
the King&#8217;s possession by reason of the forfeiture of the Friars of Harehope,
abiding at the faith and peace of the King and kingdom of England,
contrary to the faith and peace of the King and kingdom of the Scots,
(racione forisfacture Fratrum de Harehope ad fidem et pacem Regis et
regni Anglie, ac contra fidem et pacem nostras existencium). The grant
was to lapse when the Friars of Harehope became reconciled to the faith
and peace of the King and kingdom of the Scots.&mdash;(<i>Registrum Magni
Sigilli Regum Scotorum</i>, p. 132. Edin. 1814.)</p>

<p>These notices do not enable us to fix the position of Harop or Harehope,
showing only that it had lands near Edinburgh. The only other
notice of the house which I have observed rather perplexes the question
than otherwise. It occurs in the history of the deprivation of English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
priests of their Scotch benefices, given by Fordun (<i>Scotichronicon</i>, lib. xi.
cap. xxi.), and, with some variations, in a memorial of a Scotch monk
claiming the Priory of Coldingham, about 1422, printed in the <i>Priory of
Coldingham</i>, pp. 246-258. Lond. 1841, Surtees Soc. It is here said
that Harehope, or Holme, was founded by King David, the son of St.
Margaret; that certain lands in Lothian were annexed to it, in the neighbourhood
of Edinburgh, namely Spitalton and St.&nbsp;Giles&#8217; Grange; that the
monks (<i>monachi</i>) and laymen of the house, being Englishmen, conspired
against the realm of Scotland; that King David therefore declared their
lands forfeited, and bestowed them on Walter of Wardlaw, Bishop of
Glasgow, for his life; that after Bishop Wardlaw&#8217;s death the lands were
given to his kinsman the Laird of Ricarton, by whose heirs they were
possessed at the time this record was written. The memorial printed in
the <i>Priory of Coldingham</i> expressly quotes the Ricarton charters&mdash;&#8220;Ut
patet in cartis dicti domini de Ricarton exinde confectis.&#8221; If these be
still extant, they may remove the doubts which meanwhile may attach to
the question whether the &#8220;Harehope or Holme&#8221; of Fordun and the
Scotch Prior of Coldingham be certainly the same with the &#8220;Harehop&#8221;
of the <i>Rotuli Scoti&aelig;</i> in 1296, and the charter of King Robert II. in 1376.
The possessors of the latter are described as Friars (<i>fratres</i>), of the former
as monks (<i>monachi</i>)&mdash;an all-important distinction in that age, and not at
all likely to be overlooked. Then, again, Fordun and the Scotch Prior of
Coldingham say nothing of the grant of the possessions of Harehope to
the Earl of Carrick,&mdash;if, indeed, they do not relate grants of these possessions
incompatible with the charter of King Robert II. in 1376. On the
other hand, we have, both in that charter and the notices of Fordun and
the Scotch Prior of Coldingham, mention of the same lands of Spitaltoun
and St.&nbsp;Giles&#8217; Grange as the possessions of Harehope.</p>

<p>The Spitaltoun here referred to may perhaps be identified with the
&#8220;Spittle toun&#8221; of Upper Liberton, near Edinburgh. At the same time
there is a Spitaltoun in the lands of Warristoun, near Ricarton.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>In Spottiswood&#8217;s <i>Account of the Religious Houses in Scotland</i>, it is
said that the hospital of St.&nbsp;Mary Magdalene, near Linlithgow, &#8220;was formerly
governed by the Lazarites.&#8221;&mdash;(Bp. Keith&#8217;s <i>Catal. of Scotch Bishops</i>,
p. 477, edit. 1824.) It is added that the hospital at Lanark &#8220;belonged
likewise to this sect.&#8221; It does not necessarily follow from the words of
the charter in the <i>Registrum de Neubotle</i> (p. 149) that the Friars of St.
Lazarus, there spoken of, had their Hospital in Linlithgow. The words
are,&mdash;&#8220;Unam particam terre cum crofto de quarta parte illius tofti quod
tenui de Fratribus de Sancto Lazaro in villa de Lynlitgu in burgagis
scilicet illum particum terre que iacet ex orientali parte illius tofti.&#8221; The
object here seems to be rather to indicate the position of the piece of land
as being in Linlithgow than to describe the Friars of St.&nbsp;Lazarus as being
located there.</p>

<p><i>Rothfan or Rathven.</i>&mdash;In 1563 the money rent of the hospital of
Rathven seems to have been &pound;35 : 4s. In 1798 the hospital had 3 acres
of land, 6 bolls of oatmeal, and &pound;3 : 15s. of money rent.&mdash;<i>Antiquities of

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Dates of the Appearance of Leprosy in Great Britain.</span></p>

<p><i>Ireland.</i>&mdash;Ireland is excluded from consideration, else proof of the existence
of leprosy in that island in the end of the seventh century might
be adduced. St.&nbsp;Finan, a native of Munster, who died between 675 and
695, &#8220;was surnamed Lobhar, or the Leper, from his having been afflicted
for thirty years of his life with some cutaneous disorder.&#8221;&mdash;(Dr. Lanigan&#8217;s
<i>Ecclesiastical History of Ireland</i>, vol. iii. pp. 83-88; Dublin, 1822.)</p>

<p><i>England.</i>&mdash;As to England, says Mr. Albert Way, &#8220;it has been affirmed
that leprosy was brought into Europe by the Crusaders; in the Anglo-Saxon
vocabulary, however, which has been attributed to Aelfric, occurs
the word &#8216;<span class="smcap">Leprosus</span> = hreofliz, o&eth;&eth;e, lic&eth;rowera,&#8217; Jul. A, II. f. 123.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Promptorium
Parvulorum</i>, vol. i. p. 297; Lond. 1843. Camden Soc.)</p>

<p>To the instances given by Sir James Simpson, Part I., p. <a href="#Page_39">39</a>, of the
occurrence of leprosy in England before the first Crusade, may be added
the case of a noble Englishman of the south of England&mdash;<i>nobili viro sed
leproso</i>&mdash;miraculously cured at the tomb of St.&nbsp;Cuthbert at Durham, as
related by Reginald of Durham from the recital of a fellow-monk, Turold&mdash;&#8220;qui
se h&aelig;c audisse a veteranis canonicis asseruit, in quorum presentia
et aspectu hoc gestum fuit.&#8221; The canons here spoken of were ejected from
Durham in 1083&mdash;thirteen years before the first Crusade. Reginald of
Durham wrote before 1195. He speaks of the disease thus:&mdash;&#8220;Accidit
ut lepr&aelig; morbum passim eam enutriendo incurreret, ita ut, modico interposito
tempore, tota vultus illius superficies horribilis videntibus appareret.
Suis etiam quandoque, sanie ulcerum difluente, factus est evitabilis; et in
consortii communione nonnullis effectus intolerabilis.&#8221; Yet, when he
journeyed from the south of England to the tomb of St.&nbsp;Cuthbert he was
&#8220;nobilibus juvenum ministrantium, amicorum et parentum, constipatus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
agminibus.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Reginaldi Dunelmensis Libbellus de Beati Cuthberti Virtutibus</i>,
cap. xix. pp. 37-41; Lond. 1835. Surtees Soc.)</p>

<p>The disease was probably not unknown among the Anglo-Saxons, yet
the silence of their laws (the word Leper is not to be found in the index to
Thorpe&#8217;s Collection) with regard to it, contrasts strongly with the frequent
enactments for its prevention in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
both in England and Scotland, and (if we allow the Welsh laws the antiquity
which is claimed for them) in the tenth and eleventh centuries in
Wales. May not the anomaly be explained by supposing that the disease
broke out with new severity about the beginning of the twelfth century?</p>

<p><i>Scotland.</i>&mdash;No trace of leprosy is to be found in Adamnan&#8217;s Life of St.
Columba, written in the seventh century. But of one of St.&nbsp;Columba&#8217;s contemporaries&mdash;St.
Kentigern of Glasgow, who died about 600&mdash;it is related
that in that city he cleansed lepers&mdash;&#8220;mundabat leprosos.&#8221; These are
the words of his biographer, Joceline of Furnes, who wrote towards the
end of the twelfth century.&mdash;(<i>Vit. S. Kentigerni</i>, cap. xxxiv.; Pinkert. <i>Vit.
Antiq. Sanct. Scoti&aelig;</i>, p. 270.) The same biographer relates that at St.
Kentigern&#8217;s tomb in Glasgow lepers were cured&mdash;&#8220;leprosis cutis munditia
restituitur.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Vit. S. Kentigerni</i>, cap. xliv.; Pinkert. <i>Vit. Antiq. SS.
Scot.</i>, p. 295.)</p>

<p>So also it is related of St.&nbsp;Boniface of Rosemarky, who appears to have
flourished in the beginning of the eighth century, that he cleansed lepers&mdash;&#8220;leprosos
mundabat.&#8221; These are the words of the Breviary of Aberdeen
(Proprium Sanctorum pro tempore hyemali, fol. lxx.), printed in 1510,
but quoting and using older materials.</p>

<p>St.&nbsp;Aelred of Rievaux, who died in 1166, relates that lepers were
cleansed at the tomb of St.&nbsp;Ninian at Whithern in Galloway&mdash;&#8220;ad ejus
namque sacratissimum tumulum curantur infirmi, mundantur leprosi.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Vit.
S. Ninian</i>, cap. xi.) He mentions specially two cases:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Visi sunt pr&aelig;terea venire in civitatem viri duo leprosi. Qui pr&aelig;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
sumptuosum &aelig;stimantes cum lepr&aelig; contagio scabiem tangere, quasi
delonge poscunt auxilium. Accedentes autem ad fontem, et
sanctum arbitrantes quidquid sanctus contigerat Ninianus, lavacio
illo se abluendos putarunt.... Mundantur leprosi tactu
lavacio, sed meritis Niniani.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Vit. S. Niniani</i>, cap. xi. &sect; 4;
Pinkert. <i>Vit. Antiq. SS. Scot.</i>, pp. 22, 23.)</p></div>

<p>All these writers&mdash;St.&nbsp;Aelred of Rievaux, Joceline of Furnes, and the
compiler of the Aberdeen Breviary&mdash;wrote so long after the Saints whose
miracles they commemorate, that their testimony cannot avail as proof in
itself of the existence of leprosy in Scotland in the seventh and eighth centuries.
Besides, they speak only in general terms&mdash;&#8220;leprosos mundabat,&#8221;&mdash;which
may be little or nothing more than a rhetorical flourish. But the
passages which have been quoted are at least sufficient to demonstrate that
in the twelfth century the existence of leprosy in Scotland from a remote
age was a matter of unquestioned belief. Of the general prevalence of the
disease on this side of the Tweed in that and the subsequent age, there
is abundant evidence elsewhere in the Leges Burgorum and other
ancient capitularies of Scotch law.</p>

<p class="tb">The canon of the Scotch Church, &#8220;De monitionem faciendo leprosis,&#8221;
printed in the Registrum Episcopatus Aberdonensis, vol. ii. p. 32, and
elsewhere, belongs to the thirteenth century, probably to the latter part of
that century. If, as seems to be the case, it be merely a diocesan statute,
and not a statute for the whole of Scotland, it will only show more forcibly
the general prevalence of the disease. The diocese for which it was
enacted was apparently Aberdeen, containing at that time about eighty
parishes, and the number of lepers must have been great before it could
be found necessary to guard against the injury done to the parochial
clergy by the withdrawal of the dues and oblations of the inmates of the
leper hospitals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p>&#8220;If a person become a surety, and before the termination of the
suit he should become leprous, or a monk, or blind, ....
he must fulfil his promise while he lives.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Ancient Laws and
Institutes of Wales</i>, p. 403.)</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p>&#8220;There is to be no objection to a pleader, but for having violated
his religious profession, and quitting the world, or his becoming
a separated leper.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales</i>,
p. 516.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Three sons who are not to have patrimony&mdash;The son of a priest,
the son of a leper, and the son of a man who had paid his
patrimony as blood land. The son of a leper is not to have it,
because God has separated him from worldly kin&mdash;that is, such
son as a leper may have after being adjudged to a lazar-house;
and a son a priest shall have after taking priestly orders; and
the third has no patrimony, as his father, prior to him, had
determined it by law.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales</i>,
p. 556. See also p. 603.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Three persons to whom saraad [fine for insult] is not due&mdash;A
leper, a natural fool, and an alltud [an alien serf] who is not
married to an innate Cymraes: And, nevertheless, there is worth
in law attached to each of them, and whoever shall ill-use them
and injure them in person and property is subject to a dirwy
[fine or punishment].&mdash;(<i>Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales</i>,
p. 656.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Three persons who are not to be invested with the judicial
function&mdash;An inefficient person, as one that is deaf, or blind, or
maimed, or leprous, or insane, or mute,&#8221; etc. etc.&mdash;(<i>Ancient Laws
and Institutes of Wales</i>, p. 671.)</p>

<p>&#8220;A leper cannot be a pleader.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Ancient Laws and Institutes of
Wales</i>, p. 764.)</p></div>

<p>The Welsh term for leper is <i>Clafwr</i>, obviously an adaptation of the
Latin word.</p>

<p>It should be kept in view that the license which the Welsh laws give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
to the wife to leave a leprous husband is in direct contradiction to the
canon law as declared by Pope Alexander III. to the Archbishop of
Canterbury in 1180:&mdash;&#8220;Mandamus quatenus si qui sunt in provincia tua
viri vel mulieres qui lepr&aelig; morbum incurrunt, ut uxores viros et viri
uxores sequantur, et eis conjugali affectione ministrent, sollicitis exhortationibus
inducere non postponas. Si vero ad hoc induci non poterunt,
eis arctius injungas ut uterque altero vivente continentiam servet. Quodsi
mandatum tuum servare contempserint, vinculo excommunicationis
adstringas.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>, vol. ii. col. 656. Edit. 1747.)</p>

<p>The same Pope, in the same year, decreed that lepers might marry:&mdash;
&#8220;Leprosi autem si continere nolunt, et aliquam qu&aelig; sibi nubere velit
invenerint, liberum est eis ad matrimonium convolare.&#8221; He settled
another and more delicate point:&mdash;&#8220;Quodsi virum sive uxorem divino
judicio leprosum fieri contigerit, et infirmus a sano carnale debitum
exigat, generali pr&aelig;cepto Apostoli, quod exigitur est solvendum: cui
pr&aelig;cepto nulla in hoc casu exceptio invenitur.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>,
vol. ii. col. 656. Edit. 1747.)</p>

<p>Pope Urban III. found, in 1186, that subsequent leprosy was a sufficient
reason why betrothed persons should not be compelled to marry.&mdash;(<i>Corpus
Juris Canonici</i>, vol. ii. col. 657. Edit. 1747. See also col. 344.)</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Nomenclature of the Disease.</span>&mdash;The terms &#8220;Leprosi&#8221; and
&#8220;Elephantuosi.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;MS. History of the Durham Cathedral and Diocese,&#8221; referred to
in Sir James Simpson&#8217;s Paper, Part II. p. 77, was printed in Wharton&#8217;s
<i>Anglia Sacra</i> in 1691, and more perfectly in the <i>Histori&aelig; Dunelmensis
Scriptores Tres</i>, by the Surtees Society in 1839. The passage quoted
stands thus (pp. 11, 12):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p>&#8220;Pr&aelig;terea Hospitale de Schyreburne construxit, et elefantiosos in
episcopatu suo circumquaque collectos, ibidem instituit, aptisque
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>eorum usibus habitaculis ampliant; et ne quid sollicitudini
caritatis deesset, ad eorum perpetuam sustentationem et nonnullorum
susceptionem terras et ecclesias concessit et confirmavit.
In geminum creditur esse bonum, quod et pauperum necessitatibus
liberrime prospexit, et societatem immundorum a cohabitacione
mundorum segregavit.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>&#8220;Elephantuosi&#8221; is here put as equivalent to &#8220;Leprosi.&#8221; In the
Chronicle of Battle Abbey, written about 1180-1200, some slight distinction
seems to be implied between the words. The writer is speaking of
the Abbot Walter, who died in 1171:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p>&#8220;Leprosorum maxime et elephantiosorum ab hominibus ejectioni
compatiens, eos non solum non abhorrebat, verumetiam in persona
propria eis frequenter ministrans, eorum manus pedesque
abluendo fovebat, et intimo caritatis pietatisque affectu blanda
oscula imprimebat.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Chronicon Monasterii de Bello</i>, p. 135;
Lond. 1846. Anglia Christiana.)</p></div>

<p>But, after all, the two terms may here be used merely rhetorically.
There are other instances of such a tautology. Ducange (t. iii. coll. 49,
50), quotes <i>Elephanti&aelig; lepra</i> and &#8220;Leprosi enim vere atque Elephantia
debent habere.&#8221; At the same time he cites from an old Latin-French
Glossary, &#8220;<span class="smcap">Elephancia</span> = une maniere de mesclerie.&#8221; In the same way
some writers distinguish between <i>mesellerie</i> and <i>cordrerie</i>. On the other
hand, the <i>Catholicon Anglicum</i>, an Anglo-Latin Dictionary of the year
1483, has &#8220;<span class="smcap">A Lepyr</span> = lepra, elefancia, missella.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Promptorium Parvulorum</i>,
vol. i. pp. 297, 298. Lond. 1843. Camden Soc.)</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Description of a Leper.</span></p>

<p>Reginald of Durham (sometimes also called Reginald of Coldingham),
a Benedictine monk, who wrote before 1195, gives the following descrip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>tion
of a leper girl who had been for three years in the hospital at
Budele, near Darlington, in the bishopric of Durham:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p>&#8220;Nempe omnem facierum illius superficiem lacer&aelig; putredinis
cicatrix nunquam sana totam obduxerat, et falliculis [<i>l.</i> folliculis]
crud&aelig; carnis sparsim patentibus et hiulco meatu saniem venenoso
meatu rimantibus, horridam cunctis visu reddiderat. Labiorumque
ipsius extrema circumquaque marcentia diriguerant, quia
particulares quasdam ejus regiones usque ad profunda qu&aelig;dam
dimensionum dispendia vis s&aelig;va diutini languoris consumendo
exederat. His itaque aliisque illius aegritudinus modis corpus
ejus dilaceratum periit,&#8221; etc.&mdash;(<i>Libellus de Vita et Miraculis S.
Godrici</i>, p. 456. Lond. 1847. Surtees Soc.)</p></div>

<p>The leprosy is cured by a miracle at the tomb of S. Godric at Finchale,
when the appearance of the face is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p>&#8220;tota sana comparuit, omnisque lepr&aelig; prioris f&oelig;da scabies jam
recesserat, labiaque illius sana ac tenua, facies vero tota incontacta
ac clara, velut parvuli cujusdam triennis apparebat. Qu&aelig;
una cum matre sospes domum rediit, qu&aelig; illo prius tota lepr&aelig;
pustulis et sanie contracta pervenit.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Among other witnesses to the miraculous cure, Ralph Haget, sheriff
of Durham,</p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p>&#8220;dicebat quod facies ejus cutis licet sana, tenera sit et clara, tamen
ubi cicatrices ulcerum quondam fuerant illa superficies videtur
aliquantulum comparere subrufa; labiorum vero extrema qu&aelig;
frustris carneis pinis fuerant valliculata, tota sunt plena atque
rotunda, sed aliquanto altius prominentia.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>This was confirmed also by Norman the priest of Hailtune, who got
the girl into the lepers&#8217; hospital at Badele, near Darlington, and who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
subsequently showed her to his parishioners in his church.&mdash;(<i>Libellus de
Vita et Miraculis S. Godrici</i>, pp. 457, 458.)</p>

<p>The same writer, in the same work, gives other descriptions of leprosy.
A young shepherd of the north of England &#8220;lepra percussus cunctis
horrori fuit.&#8221; He is miraculously cured&mdash;&#8220;tumorque omnis cum deformi
rubore fugatus abscesserat, novaque coloris insoliti superficies in facie et
toto corpore ipsius relucebat; et nulla omnino pustula vel cicatricis macula
in ipso residendo comparuit.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Lib. de Vit. et Mirac. S. Godrici</i>, p. 431.)</p>

<p>A woman&mdash;&#8220;diutino tempore toto corpore lepr&aelig; fuerat contagio

nulli pene ad videndum tolerabilis fuerat.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Lib. de Vit. et Mirac.
S. Godrici</i>, p. 431.)</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Rank of the Persons attacked by Leprosy.</span></p>

<p>In 1203, a piece of land in Sudton in Kent was in dispute in the
King&#8217;s court between two kinswomen&mdash;Mabel, the daughter of William
Fitz Fulke, and Avicia, the widow of Warine Fitz Fulke. Among other
pleas, it was urged by Avicia, that Mabel had a brother, and that his
right to the land must exclude her claim. Mabel answered that her
brother was a leper&mdash;&#8220;E contra dicit Mabilla quod leprosus est.&#8221; The
judgment is not recorded; but the notice shows two things&mdash;(1) The
doctrine of the civil death which followed leprosy; (2) The comparatively
good condition of the person who in this instance was smitten with leprosy.</p>

<p>The case is recorded in the <i>Placitorum in Domo Capitulari Westmonesteriensi
asservatorum Abbreviatio</i>, p. 39. Lond. 1811. Record
Commission.</p>

<p>In 1280 it was certified to King Edward I. that Adam of Gangy,
brother and heir of Ralph of Gangy, deceased, of the county of Northumberland,
holding land of the king in chief, was struck with leprosy
(<i>leperia percussus</i>), so that he could not conveniently repair to the king&#8217;s
presence to pay his homage to the king (quod ad presenciam Regis ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
homagium suum Regi faciendum commode accedere non potest). It was
therefore ordered that Thomas of Normanville, the elder, should in lieu
and turn of the king take the leper&#8217;s fealty for his lands.&mdash;(<i>Rotulorum
Originalium in Curia Scaccarii Abbreviatio</i>, vol. i. p. 33. Lond. 1805.)</p>

<p>Here, again, we see leprosy attacking a person of comparatively high
position. But here the disease neither inferred civil death nor excluded
the leper from all intercourse with his fellows.</p>

<p>In 1313, Nicholas the Leper (Nicholaus le Lepere) and William the
Leper (Willielmus le Lepere) are manucaptors or pledges that John de
la Poile, knight of the shire returned for Surrey, will do his duty in Parliament.&mdash;(<i>Palgrave&#8217;s
Parliamentary Writs</i>, vol. ii. pp. 89, 113.)</p>

<p>Here we have a family of note bearing the name of Leper, derived no
doubt from the leprosy of an ancestor.</p>

<p>Before 1083 a miraculous cure of leprosy is said to have been effected
at the shrine of St.&nbsp;Cuthbert at Durham, on the person of a noble of the
south of England&mdash;&#8220;vir quidam in longinqua Australium Anglorum
regione qui mult&aelig; nobilitatis gratia inter comprovintiales preditus erat.
Hic tam corporis sani virtute gaudebat, quam omni prosperitatis affluentia;
et divitiarum gloria c&aelig;teros excedebat,&#8221; etc. etc.&mdash;(<i>Reginaldi
Dunelmensis Libellus de Beati Cuthberti Virtutibus</i>, pp. 37-41. Lond.
1835.  Surtees Soc.)</p>

<p>The same writer, in another work, relates the cure of three lepers at
the tomb of St.&nbsp;Godric of Finchale. One, a male, was a shepherd; the
other two were women, apparently of the middle or lower ranks.&mdash;(<i>Reginaldi
Dunelmensis Libellus de Vita et Miraculis S. Godrici</i>, pp. 430, 431,
455-458. Lond. 1845. Surtees Soc.) The shepherd was a youth
(<i>juvenis</i>); one of the women was a girl (<i>puella</i>).</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Lepers among the Clergy.</span></p>

<p>Another illustration of the prevalence of leprosy among the English
clergy, alluded to at p. <a href="#Page_106">106</a>, Part III., is supplied by the will of Richard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Basy, of Bylburgh, in Yorkshire, in 1393:&mdash;&#8220;Item lego presbiteris c&aelig;cis
vel leprosis seu aliter languentibus, qui non valent celebrare circa divinum
officium celebrandum, et aliis pauperibus eodem modo languentibus et
jacentibus, xl. solidos.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Testamenta Eboracensia</i>, vol. i. p. 192. Lond.
1836. Surtees Soc.)</p>

<p>Pope Lucius III. decreed in 1181 that rectors of churches who were
struck with leprosy should serve their cures by coadjutors; and Pope
Clement III., in 1190, ordained that leprous priests should be removed
from their priestly office, but should be supported from the fruits of their
benefices.&mdash;(<i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>, vol. ii. coll. 447-448. Edit. 1747.)</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Case of King Robert Bruce.</span></p>

<p>The silence of Wyntoun, Fordun, and our other early Scotch
chroniclers, as to the disease of which King Robert Bruce died, may not
improbably be explained by their reluctance to associate the heroic
monarch with an odious and degrading malady. But the King&#8217;s metrical
biographer names his disease, or at least its origin; and it would be
interesting to know if that disease can be identified with leprosy.</p>

<p>What is &#8220;enfundeying,&#8221; as Dr. Jamieson calls it, or &#8220;ane fundying,&#8221;
as Mr. Innes makes it? Dr. Jamieson glosses it as &#8220;perhaps asthma,&#8221;
but on what ground I do not see. At the same time I am unable to
suggest any interpretation of the term. Can medical nomenclature
supply none?</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Contagiousness of Leprosy.</span></p>

<p>To the list of persons (Part III. pp. 133, 134) who tended or even kissed
lepers without being smitten with the disease, may be added Walter de
Luci, Abbot of Battle, in Sussex, from 1139 to 1171, who often washed
and kissed the feet and hands of lepers&mdash;<i>eorum manus pedesque abluendo
fovebat, et intimo caritatis pietatisque affectu blanda oscula imprimebat</i>.&mdash;(<i>Chronicon
Monasterii de Bello</i>, p. 135. Lond. 1846. Anglia
Christiana.)</p>

<p>The story (Sir James Simpson&#8217;s Paper, Part III. p. 134) quoted from
Matthew Paris, about the good Queen Maud, is to be found in an earlier
writer, St.&nbsp;Aelred of Rievaux, from whose <i>Genealogia Regum Anglorum</i>
Matthew Paris, or rather Roger of Wendover, borrowed it. It may be
remarked, generally, that late editors have shown that all that part of
Matthew Paris&#8217; history which is previous to the year 1235 is really the
work of Roger of Wendover. As such it has been reprinted by the
English Historical Society.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">List of Leper Hospitals.</span></p>

<p><i>Oxford, St.&nbsp;Bartholomew.</i>&mdash;The date of foundation of this hospital
is left blank in the list of British Leper Hospitals, p. <a href="#Page_160">160</a>. It certainly
existed before the 24th November 1200, when the lepers of St.&nbsp;Bartholomew
of Oxford had letters of protection from King John.&mdash;(<i>Rot.
Chart. in Turr. Lund.</i> vol. i. p. 99.)</p>

<p><i>Berington.</i>&mdash;On the 20th July 1199 King John confirms to the
canons regular of Lantony, among their other possessions, the half of
Berington, which had been given to them by the Earl Roger for the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>procuration
of thirteen lepers&mdash;&#8220;<i>Ex dono Rogeri Comitis aliam dimidietatem

sense of <i>necessaria ad victum et vestitum</i>.&mdash;(See Ducange, t. v. col. 885.)</p>

<p><i>Carlisle.</i>&mdash;The lepers of Carlisle had letters of protection from King
John on 25th February 1201.&mdash;(<i>Rot. Chart. in Turr. Lund.</i> vol. i. p. 101.)</p>

<p><i>Badele, near Darlington, in the county of Durham.</i>&mdash;The reception of
a leprous girl into the hospital of Badele, about three miles from Darlington,
is related by Reginald of Durham in his <i>Libellus de Vita et Miraculis
S. Godrici</i>, p. 456. Lond. 1845. (Surtees Soc.) The work was written
before 1195.</p>

<p><i>Canterbury.</i>&mdash;The date of foundation of this hospital is left blank in
the list of British Leper Hospitals, p. <a href="#Page_158">158</a>. It certainly existed before the
death of Archbishop Lanfranc in 1089, for the contemporary historian of
Canterbury expressly says it was built by him:&mdash;&#8220;Ligneas domos in

istis a f&oelig;minarum societate sejunctis.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Eadmeri Hist. Novorum</i>, p. 9.
Lond. 1623.)</p>

<p><i>York.</i>&mdash;<i>One</i> leper hospital at York is noted in the list of British
Leper Hospitals, at p. <a href="#Page_161">161</a>. There were <i>four</i>. The will of Henry of
Blythe, painter of York, in 1365, has this bequest:&mdash;&#8220;Item lego quatuor

Eboracensia</i>, vol. i. p. 75. Lond. 1836. Surtees Soc.)
The will of Master Adam Wigan, rector of St.&nbsp;Saviour&#8217;s, York, in 1433,
has&mdash;&#8220;Item lego cuilibet domui quatuor domorum leprosorum iij s. iiij d.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Test.
Ebor.</i> vol. ii. p. 26. Lond. 1855. Surtees Soc.) The will
of Richard Russell, citizen and merchant of York, in 1435, shows that at
York, as elsewhere, the leper hospitals were beyond the city walls:&mdash;&#8220;Et
cuilibet leproso in quatuor domibus Leprosorum in suburbiis Ebor.,

Leprosorum in suburbiis Ebor., xx solidos per equales portiones.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Test.
Ebor.</i> vol. ii. p. 93.) The lepers of York have similar bequests in 1446,
in 1454, and 1441.&mdash;(<i>Test. Ebor.</i> vol. ii. pp. 115, 182, 187.) I do not
observe any legacies to them after 1454.</p>

<p><i>Beverley.</i>&mdash;The leper hospital here, as at York, Canterbury, Glasgow,
Stirling, Aberdeen, etc., stood in the suburbs. The will of John Brompton,
merchant of Beverley, in 1444, has this legacy&mdash;&#8220;Item leprosis extra

<p><i>Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</i>&mdash;The will of Roger Thornton, merchant of
Newcastle, in 1429, has this legacy&mdash;&#8220;Item to the Lepre men of Newcastell,
xl s.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Northern Wills and Inventories</i>, part i. p. 78. Lond.
1835. Surtees Soc.)</p>

<p><i>Winchester.</i>&mdash;The existence of a leper hospital at Winchester is
shown by the will of Martin of Holy Rood, master of the hospital of
Sherborn, in 1259 [referred to in Sir James Simpson&#8217;s Paper, Part I., p.
36]&mdash;&#8220;Fratribus Leprosis Wyntonie, ij solidos.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Northern Wills and
Inventories</i>, part i. p. 10.)</p>

<p><i>Lynne, Norfolk.</i>&mdash;<i>Five</i> leper hospitals at Lynne, in Norfolk, are
enumerated in the list of British Leper Hospitals, p. <a href="#Page_160">160</a>. There seem to
have been <i>six</i>. Mr. Albert Way, in a note to the <i>Promptorium Parvulorum</i>,
vol. i. p. 297, Lond. 1843 (Camden Soc.), cites, from Parkins&#8217;
<i>Account of Lynne, in Blomf. Norf.</i> iv. 608, the bequest of Stephen
Guybor, in 1432, to every house of lepers about Lynn, &#8220;namely, at
West Lynn, Cowgate, Herdwyk, Setchehithe, Mawdelyn, and Geywode.&#8221;
Four of these may be identified with those in the list, p. <a href="#Page_160">160</a>. &#8220;West
Lynn&#8221; and &#8220;Cowgate&#8221; are the same in both lists; &#8220;Mawdelyn&#8221; is &#8220;St.
Mary Magdalene&#8217;s;&#8221; and &#8220;Setchehithe&#8221; is &#8220;Setch Hithe.&#8221;</p>

<h2>NOTES ON SOME ANCIENT GREEK MEDICAL VASES
FOR CONTAINING LYKION; AND ON THE MODERN
USE OF THE SAME DRUG IN INDIA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> physicians and surgeons who, in ancient times, pursued their
medical profession at Rome, and in different parts of the Roman
empire, have left us various palpable relics of their craft. Thus, in
the ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum, numerous surgical instruments,
pharmacy and drug-bottles, etc., have been found; and
elaborate drawings and accounts of these have lately been published
by Savenko, Vulpes, Renzi, and others. On the sites of the old
Roman cities and colonies throughout Western Europe, various
surgical and medical relics of the same kind have been at different
times discovered; as lancets, probes, cupping-glasses, scalpels,
oculist-stamps, phials, etc. But of medicine, as it was still earlier
exercised in Greece and in the Grecian colonies, few such tangible
vestiges remain. We have, it is true, had carefully transmitted
down to us the imperishable professional writings of Hippocrates
and others of the purely Greek school; but time has spared few, or
indeed almost no, material remnants of the professional instruments
or vessels used by the ancient Greek surgeons and physicians.</p>

<p>Perhaps the great rarity of such arch&aelig;ological remains may
serve as some apology for the present notice of some specimens of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
ancient Greek medical vessels or vases. Besides, the vases which
I wish to describe are interesting in other points of view. They
are all of them intended to contain one and the same drug, as shown
by the inscriptions on their exterior; this drug was derived by the
ancient Greeks chiefly from Hindostan,&mdash;one of the many points of
evidence of the former freedom and frequency of the traffic between
the south of Europe and India; and at the present day the same
drug is still employed extensively and successfully, by the native
practitioners of the East, for the very purposes for which it was,
in former times, used by the medical practitioners of Greece.</p>

<p>The drug to which I allude is the <i>Indian Lycium</i> or <i>Lykion</i>,
the &#923;&#933;&#922;&#921;&#927;&#925; &#921;&#925;&#916;&#921;&#922;&#927;&#925; of Dioscorides. In modern collections and
writings, I know of four ancient vases or drug-bottles intended to
contain this valued eye-medicine. If our museums, however, were
properly searched, perhaps various other Greek vases, for the same
or for similar medicines, would be detected. The four specimens
of bottles or vases for <i>Lycium</i>, to which I have adverted, are the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. In the collection of Greek antiquities contained in the British
Museum is a small vase, made of lead, and of the exact form and
size represented in Plate, Fig. 1. The vase is of a sub-ovoid
form, and is somewhat above an inch in height, and about three
quarters of an inch in breadth. An inscription, preceded by the
ornament of a small tripod, encircles the middle of the vase. The
inscription is in Greek letters, of which the following is a correct
copy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="ins" id="ins"></a><img src="images/ins.png" width="500" height="48"
alt="LYKION PARAMOUSAIOU" title="" /></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>This inscription may be read as &#923;&#933;&#922;&#921;&#927;&#925; &#928;&#913;&#929;&#913;&#924;&#927;&#933;&#931;&#913;&#921;&#927;&#933;&mdash;the
<i>Lycium of Paramusaeus</i>&mdash;as suggested to me by Mr. Birch, who
first had the kindness to direct my attention to this vase, or, and perhaps
more correctly, it may be rendered &#923;&#933;&#922;&#921;&#927;&#925; &#928;&#913;&#929;&#913; &#924;&#927;&#933;&#931;&#913;&#921;&#927;&#933;&mdash;the
<i>Lycium</i> sold <i>by Musaeus</i>. Mr. Birch informs me that he
thinks he met with the name of <i>Paramusaeus</i> as a medical practitioner
in Fabricius&#8217; <i>Bibliotheca Gr&aelig;ca</i>. I have not been fortunate
enough to detect the name in question, notwithstanding some considerable
search through that learned work. On the other hand,
the name of <i>Museus</i>, or <i>Musaeus</i>, is well known in Athenian
biography. (See Fabricius&#8217; <i>Bibliotheca</i>, vol. i. pp. 120-133.) I
should, perhaps, have already stated, that the vase in question was
sent to the British Museum, among a collection of antiquities from
Athens.</p>

<p>2. Through the kindness of M. Sichel of Paris, I am enabled to
give, in Plate, Fig. 2, an engraving of a second <i>Lycium</i> jar, not
hitherto published, of nearly the same dimensions as the specimen
contained in the British Museum. This second specimen is not
made of lead, but of pottery-ware. It bears upon its side the
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
H&#929;&#913;&#922;&#923;&#917;&#921;&deg;&#933;<br />
&#923;&#933;&#922;&deg;N
</p>

<p>This inscription&mdash;&#8220;the <i>Lycium of Heracleus</i>&#8221;&mdash;has the word
&#923;&#933;&#922;&#927;&#925; spelt without the I; errors of this kind being, as is well
known, very common in old Greek and Roman letterings.</p>

<p>3. M. Millin of Paris published, nearly forty years ago, an
account of a similar vase, found at Tarentum, a well-known Greek<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
colony and settlement (<i>Description d&#8217;un Vase trouv&eacute; &agrave; Tarente</i>.
Paris, 1814). This vase is slightly larger than either of the above,
but somewhat mutilated. It is made of clay, and has on its front,
in Greek letters, the inscription <i>Lycium of Jason</i>.</p>

<p class="center">
IAC&#7506;N&#7506;C<br />
&#923;&#933;&#922;&#921;&#7506;N
</p>

<p>The form and size of this jar are represented in Plate, Fig. 3.
M. Millin fancied that probably this small vase or jar was intended
as a child&#8217;s toy; but two years after he wrote, M. Tochon d&#8217;Anneci
gave an account of a similar jar, and first suggested that it must
have been destined to contain a collyrium or an ointment&mdash;<i>destin&egrave;
&agrave; contenir un collyre ou un onguent</i>. (See his <i>Dissertation sur
l&#8217;Inscription Grecque, et sur les Pierres Antiques</i>, etc., Paris, 1816.)</p>

<p>4. The vase described by M. Tochon is delineated in Plate,
Figs. 4, 5, and 6. It is of the same material, and nearly of the
same size, but less mutilated than that previously delineated by
M. Millin. It presents also in front the same inscription (see
Fig. 5), namely&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
IAC&#7506;N&#7506;C<br />
&#923;V&#922;&#921;&#7506;N
</p>

<p>M. Tochon believes, further, that this vase was found, like that of
Millin, at Tarentum. At least, it was originally given to M.
Tochon by a person who had resided for a long time in that city,
and who had himself acquired the specimen there. M. Sichel has
reason to think it not improbable that his specimen (Fig. 2) also
came from Tarentum. And it is perhaps not uninteresting to
remark, that Galen, Celsus, and various other old medical authors,
repeatedly mention a Greek physician of the name of Heracleus or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Heraclides, who practised at Tarentum, and was the author of
various treatises on the Materia Medica, etc. (See an enumeration
of his writings, etc. in K&uuml;hn&#8217;s <i>Opuscula</i>, vol. ii., p. 156, etc.)
Among his large collection of collyria and medicines for diseases of
the eye, Galen gives formul&aelig; for making different eye medicines
bearing the name of Heracleus, as, for example, two &#8220;<i>agglutinatoria
pilorum Heraclid&aelig; Tarentini</i>&#8221; (&#7981;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#948;&#959;&#965; &#932;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8055;&#957;&#959;&#8166;). See Kuhn&#8217;s
edition of <i>Galen</i>, vol. xii. p. 741.</p>

<p>The medicine mentioned in the preceding inscriptions, the
<span class="smcap lowercase">LYCIUM</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">&#923;&#933;&#922;&#921;&#927;&#925;</span>, was a drug which enjoyed much favour among
the ancients; and it was supposed to be possessed of great medical
value and virtues. It was used principally as an astringent remedy
to restrain inflammatory and other discharges. Dioscorides, Galen,
Oribasius, and Paulus &AElig;gineta, dilate upon the medicinal properties
of the Lycium. Dioscorides recommends it as an astringent for
the cure of various complaints, as obscurities of the cornea, psoriasis,
and pruritus of the eyelids, purulent ears and tonsils, ulcers of the
gums, chapped lips, fissure of the anus; in c&aelig;liac and dysenteric
affections, both in draughts and clysters; in h&aelig;moptysis and coughs;
in female fluxes, hydrophobia, and so forth. The Indian variety,
he states, cures inflammation of the spleen and jaundice, prevents
menstruation, purges water, and is a counter-agent to deadly poisons.
(Dr. Adam&#8217;s Trans. of <i>Paulus &AElig;gineta</i>, vol. iii. p. 234.) Two
varieties of Lycium were in use&mdash;one obtained from Lycia and
Cappadocia, etc., and the other from India. The latter was regarded
as by far the most valuable. Thus, when treating of the two
varieties of Lycium, Galen mentions the Indian as the most powerful
for all purposes&mdash;&#964;&#8056; &#7992;&#957;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#7984;&#963;&#967;&#8166;&#961;&#8057;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#8057;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#7941;&#960;&#945;&#957;. (<i>De Simp. Medicam.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
lib. vii. 64.) Such late writers as Paulus &AElig;gineta, &AElig;tius, etc.,
allude also to the superior value of the Indian variety. For instance,
in Roxarius&#8217; edition of <i>Oribasius</i> it is stated that the Indian Lykion
&#8220;pr&aelig;stat ceteris et est efficacius.&#8221; (<i>Medicin. Collect.</i> lib. xi.)
Avicenna, the celebrated Arabian physician, who gives a long
account of the medical uses, etc., of Lykion, remarks, &#8220;Magis
vincens, secundum existimationem, est quod Indicum est,&#8221; etc.;
and he compares its properties with that from Mecca. (<i>Canon
Medicin&aelig;, Lib.</i> ii. cap. 398.)</p>

<p>Of all the uses to which the Lycium was applied in medicine,
by far the most important was the employment of this drug, and
particularly of the Indian variety, as a collyrium or local application
to the eye, in the treatment of different varieties and forms of
ophthalmic inflammation. Thus Scribonius Largus, the reputed
body physician to the Emperor Claudius, and one of the most
original among the ancient medical writers, declares that &#8220;he
attributes to no collyrium whatever such great efficacy as to the
genuine <i>Indian Lycium</i> used by itself. For if,&#8221; says he, &#8220;near the
commencement of ophthalmia, any one anoints himself with this
collyrium, he will immediately&mdash;that is, on the same day&mdash;be freed
from present pain and future swelling. It is unnecessary (he adds)
to dilate on its virtues, for a person experienced only in other
collyria would scarcely credit the effects of this simple drug.&#8221; (<i>De
Composit. Medicamentorum</i>, cap. 3.) Marcellus lauds its power in
nearly the same words. (<i>De Medicam. Lib.</i> cap. 8.)</p>

<p>The Lykion, or Lycium, is still used extensively by the native
medical practitioners of India, under the Hindoo name of <i>Rusot</i> or
<i>Ruswut</i>. In a learned article on the nature of the &#955;&#8059;&#954;&#953;&#959;&#957; of Diosco<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>rides,
contained in the <i>Transactions of the Linn&aelig;an Society</i>, vol.
xvii. p. 82, Professor Royle has shown that the Indian Lycium or
Rusot is an inspissated extract, prepared from the wood or roots of
several species of Berberis, as the <i>Berberis lycium, aristata</i>, etc.,
growing on the mountains and plains of Upper India, and principally
procured from Nuggur-kote, near Lahore.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> &#8220;On inquiring,&#8221;
says Dr. Royle, &#8220;in the shops of the druggists in the bazaars of
India, I everywhere learned that both the wood (<i>dar-huld</i>) and the
extract Rusot were imported from the hills into the plains, and
that large quantities continued to be brought from Nuggur-kote as
well as other places.&#8221; And he adds,&mdash;&#8220;The <i>Rusot</i> is at the present
day procurable in every bazaar in India, and used by the native
practitioners, who are fond of applying it both in incipient and
chronic inflammation of the eye; and in the latter state both simply
and in combination with opium and alum. It is sometimes
prescribed by European practitioners; and I have heard that it was
found very efficacious by Mr. M<sup>c</sup>Dowell in the ophthalmia of soldiers
who had returned from the expedition to Egypt. I have myself
occasionally prescribed it; and the native mode of application
makes it particularly eligible in cases succeeding acute inflammation,
where the eye remains much swollen. The extract is, by native
practitioners, in such cases, rubbed to a proper consistence with
a little water, sometimes with the addition of opium and alum, and
applied in a thick layer over the swollen eyelids; the addition of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>little oil I have found preferable, as preventing the too rapid desiccation.
Patients generally express themselves as experiencing considerable
relief from the application.&#8221;</p>

<p>My friend, Dr. Wise, the author of that learned work <i>Commentaries
on the Hindoo System of Medicine</i>, some time ago brought
to Scotland with him a small quantity of the Indian Lykion. I
have seen one or two cases of recent conjunctival ophthalmia treated
by the application of this Lykion, with speedy relief and cure. Dr.
Wise has been so good as furnish me with the following interesting
letter regarding his own extended experience with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The use (says Dr. Wise) of the mixture of Lykion or Ruswut is
very generally known over Hindostan, where diseases of the eye
are common, and probably over Asia and Africa, if we are to believe
that this was the black application employed with such success to
the diseased eyes of our soldiers in Egypt. It is likewise probable
that Dioscorides obtained it nearly two thousand years ago from the
East, where the plant is indigenous, and introduced it into Europe.
Having found great personal benefit from the application of the
mixture of Lykion to my eyes when inflamed, I employed it extensively
when superintendent of the Eye Infirmary, Calcutta; and so
convinced was I of its efficacy, that I brought a supply with me to
Europe, with the intention of bringing it to the notice of the profession.
I found you investigating the subject; and at your suggestion,
Dr. Walker was so kind as to try the medicine, and I am
sure will inform you of the results he saw derived from its use.
The Indian mixture consists of equal weights of Lykion and burnt
alum, with half the weight of opium. These ingredients are mixed
with lemon-juice, and reduced to the consistence of cream, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
applied round the eyelids and over the eyebrow of the inflamed
eyes. This mixture is washed off, and again applied twice in
twenty-four hours; and it was only when accompanied with fever,
that aperients and other parts of the antiphlogistic regimen were required.
In less urgent cases the mixture was only applied at night,
and produced no inconvenience, unless when it dried, and the lids
felt stiff, when it was softened by applying a little moisture. I found
the Lykion mixture most useful in all cases of inflammation of the
external tunics of the eye. When both eyes were inflamed, it was
interesting to mark the advantage this simple remedy had when
applied to one eye, while the usual remedies of leeches, blisters, etc.,
were applied to the other eye. Another most important application
of the Lykion is when the ophthalmia is accompanied with severe
pain. On such occasions, after applying the mixture, a piece of live
charcoal (<i>gool</i>) produced the most soothing effect when approached
near the eye. With this intention, the charcoal was placed upon
an earthen cup, and held on a wooden stand by the patient, and he
approached or withdrew it from the eye according to his own
feeling. The great relief in this case was in part from the anodyne
effect of the opium.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Walker has kindly given me the following note of his
experience with the Lykion at the Edinburgh Eye Dispensary:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have used (he writes me) the Indian Lykion in a considerable
number of cases of eye-disease. The affections in which I
found it most useful were those of the conjunctiva, such as the
simple, catarrhal, and pustular forms of inflammation. In them
its action was well marked and beneficial, the disease generally
subsiding in a day or two; sooner perhaps than it would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
done under the ordinary treatment. I have had no opportunity of
trying it in purulent ophthalmia; but I believe that in it also it
would prove of service. Cases of slight rheumatic and catarrho-rheumatic
inflammations have been benefited, but not cured, by it
alone. In some affections of the eyelids, as ophthalmia tarsi and
chronic ophthalmia, it did good; but such cases often get well
with very little treatment. I applied it to the eyelids in the
form of a paste, with opium and burnt alum, as recommended by
Dr. Wise. This was repeated two or three times a day. The
patients generally complained of a burning and smarting of the
lids after its application, similar to what is produced by a mustard
blister.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">The four ancient Greek vases, mentioned in the preceding
notice as inscribed with the name of the drug <i>Lykion</i> or <i>Lycium</i>,
are each of very small dimensions, the Plate representing all of
them of their original sizes and forms. They are small, in consequence,
in all probability, of the foreign drug which they contained
being difficult to procure in large quantities, and being hence an
article of high price in the markets of Greece and Italy. The
value set upon the contained drug would seem to be indicated by
another circumstance&mdash;namely, by the shape of the interior of the
vases. In the specimens described by Millin and Tochon, the
cavity of the jars is narrow and conical from above downwards,
the mouth being wide, and the interior becoming more and more
tapering and contracted as it descends downwards. The section
of the interior of the vase of Tochon, given in Plate, Fig. 6,
represents this peculiar and deceitful form of the cavity. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
consequence of this peculiarity in their form, these jars contained,
in fact, much less of the Lykion than their mere external appearance
indicated. This remark, at least, holds true of the two vases
from Tarentum bearing the name of <i>Jason</i>. The vase of <i>Museus</i>
from Athens, belonging to the British Museum, appears more
honest at least in its construction. The high price of the pure
Lykion probably led also to the fact mentioned specially by
Dioscorides (lib. i. cap. 133), Pliny (lib. xxiv. cap. 14), and Serapion
(lib. ii. cap. 398), of the frequent adulteration of the drug. And,
perhaps, as in similar inscriptions on some modern medicine-nostrums
and packets, the names of the preparer or vendor, <i>Jason</i>,
<i>Heracleus</i>, and <i>Museus</i>, stamped on the vases, were added in attestation
of the purity and unadulterated character of the drug which
these vases contained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<h2>WAS THE ROMAN ARMY PROVIDED WITH
MEDICAL OFFICERS?</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Little</span> or nothing has hitherto been written by arch&aelig;ologists
regarding the medical staff of the Roman army. Indeed, in none
of our common works on Roman antiquities, as in those of Rosini,
Kennet, Adam, Smith, Ramsay, etc., is there any allusion whatever
made to the question, whether or not the Roman troops were furnished
with medical officers. In one anonymous work on Roman
antiquities, translated from the French, and published in London
in 1750, the subject is referred to, the author stating that during
the commonwealth there were no physicians in the Roman armies;
and he adds that, even under the Emperors, &#8220;it does not appear
there were any physicians in the armies, as there are surgeons in
ours.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> Nor does there exist, as far as I am aware, in the Roman
classics, any very distinct allusion to the matter. I have also, in
vain, searched among Roman medical authors, and among the
writings of the Greek physicians who practised at Rome, for any
direct notices, relative to the medical or surgical care of the
numerous and scattered armies employed by Rome in the different
quarters of the world. In fact, the only passages, with which I am
acquainted, relating at all to the subject, consist of a casual remark
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>in one of the military epistles of Aurelian; two incidental legal
observations contained in the law writings of Modestinus, and in
the Codex of Justinian; an allusion by Vegetius to the medical
care and expense of the sick in camp; and an expression by Galen
as to the opportunities for anatomical observation presented to the
physicians during the German wars.</p>

<p>The reference to the medical superintendence of the army by
Aurelian occurs in Vopiscus&#8217; Life of that Emperor (chap. vi.) In
issuing some peremptory orders regarding the discipline of the army,
after enumerating various rigid rules which the soldiers were to
observe, Aurelian concludes with the following admonition and
announcement:&mdash;&#8220;Let each soldier aid and serve his fellow; let
them be cured gratuitously by the physicians (<i>a medicis gratis
curentur</i>); let them give nothing to soothsayers; let them conduct
themselves quietly in their hospitia; and he who would raise strife,
let him be lashed.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> The date of this order is not earlier than <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
270, the year when Aurelian became Emperor.</p>

<p>When treating of those who, by absence from Rome, etc., were
exempted from some burthens and taxes, the jurist Modestinus,
who wrote in the earlier half of the third century, mentions, among
others, the military physicians (<i>Medici Militum</i>), &#8220;because,&#8221; he adds,
&#8220;the office which they fill is beneficial to the public, and ought not
to be productive of any injury to themselves (quoniam officium,
quod gerunt, et publice prodest, et fraudem eis adferre non debet)&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>In Justinian&#8217;s <i>Corpus Juris Civilis</i>, lib. x. tit. 52, drawn up
in the sixth century, there is a series of laws, &#8220;De Professoribus et
Medicis.&#8221; The first of these laws exempts the physician of a
legion (<i>Medicum Legionis</i>) from civil duties when he is absent in
the public service.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a></p>

<p>In his work <i>De Re Militari</i>, Vegetius, who wrote towards the
end of the fourth century, devotes a chapter (lib. iii. 2) to the
regulation of the health of an army; and incidentally rather than
directly alludes to the cure of sick soldiers by the skill of the
physicians (<i>arte medicorum</i>).<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> Enumerating also elsewhere the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>duties of the Pr&aelig;fect of the Camp, he states that his authority
extended over his sick fellow-soldiers, and the physicians who had
the care of them, and he regulated the expenses relative thereto.
(Lib. ii. cap. 10.)</p>

<p>The passage I have alluded to as in the works of Galen is
of an earlier date than any of the preceding, and is to be found in
liber iii. cap. 2, of his work, <i>De Compositione Medicamentorum
per Genera</i>. In discoursing regarding the treatment of wounds,
he talks of the necessity of a knowledge of human anatomy for
their proper management. In order to know the anatomy of
man, he recommends here, as elsewhere, the anatomy of the monkey
to be studied, maintaining that without such knowledge you cannot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>take due advantage of the opportunities that you may accidentally
have presented to you of becoming acquainted with the anatomical
structure of human bodies. And he adds, that in consequence of a
want of this knowledge the physicians (&#959;&#7985; &#7984;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#953;) employed in the
German wars, and having the power of dissecting the bodies of the
barbarians, did not learn more than the cooks understand.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></p>

<p>This paragraph, though indistinct as regards the status and office
of these &#7992;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#953;, is still sufficiently explicit as to the fact that there
were physicians in the Roman army during the German wars that
Galen alludes to; and these wars were no doubt those that occurred
from the year <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 167 to 175, immediately previous to the time
when Galen wrote the work from which we have quoted.</p>

<p class="tb">The history of other more ancient governments than that of
Rome is not without allusion to the office of army physicians.
Homer,<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> Herodotus,<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> and Pliny,<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> each comment on the number
and fame of the medical men with which the kingdom of Egypt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>abounded. Diogenes Laertius, in his life of Plato, tells us of
Plato&#8217;s sickness when travelling in Egypt; and adds that he
remarked, like Homer, that the Egyptians were all physicians
(&#966;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#913;&#7988;&#947;&#965;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#7984;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#962;
&#949;&#7984;&#957;&#945;&#953;).<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> They had, moreover,
paid medical officers attendant upon their troops in war. For, in
describing the status and character of the Egyptian physicians,
Diodorus Siculus specially mentions that, when engaged in military
expeditions, the soldiers were cured without fees, for the physicians
of the army received a salary from the state.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a></p>

<p>One instance is referred to in history, in which an Egyptian
king, when thrown from his horse in battle, wounded and speechless
from injury of the head, had his skull trepanned by his surgeons.
I allude to Ptolemy Philometor, who defeated Alexander Balas, the
pretender to the throne of Syria, in the year <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 146. According
to Livy, the victor himself died after the battle during the attempts
of his surgeons to relieve him. &#8220;Ptolemaeus, in caput graviter vulneratus,
inter curationem, dum ossa medici <i>terebrare</i> contendunt,
exspiravit.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Epit.</i> lib. lii.)</p>

<p class="tb">Nor is the old classical literature of Greece without reference to
surgical services tendered to the soldier in war. Homer describes
the double character of army surgeons and warriors as combined in
the persons of Podalirius and Machaon.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> And when the latter is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>wounded, he puts into the mouth of Idomeneus the well-known
expression (Iliad, lib. xi. v. 514), that the medical man is to the
army more valuable than many warriors; knowing as he does how
to excise arrows, and to apply soothing medications:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the course of the Iliad, the surgical treatment followed in
individual cases among the disabled Greek warriors is sometimes
minutely entered upon; and thus the different modes of operation
by which the transfixing arrow, dart, and lance, were, in those early
days of surgical science, removed from the bodies of the wounded,
may be sometimes gathered from Homer&#8217;s lucid and minute descriptions.
He mentions three different methods, at least, by which
war-weapons were extracted&mdash;viz., first, by evulsion, or traction of
the weapon backwards, as in the case of Menelaus (Iliad, lib. iv.
214); secondly, by protrusion, or pushing of the instrument forward,
as in the case of Diomede (v. 112); and, thirdly, by enlarging
the wound, and cutting out the weapon, as was the practice of
Patroclus in the case of Eurypylus (xi. 843). I am not aware that
Homer ever individualises any internal medical treatment except
once (xi. 638), when he mentions a mixture of Pramnian wine,
cheese, and flour, as having been administered by the nursing hand
of Hecamede to the wounded Machaon,<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> ere she prepared the warm
bath for him and washed away the clotted blood (xiv. 7).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
The author of the ancient Greek treatise &#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054;, an essay
usually included in the works of Hippocrates, explicitly advises the
young physician to attach himself for a time to some army, in order
to learn the best methods of extracting war-weapons, and to
acquire practical skill in the treatment of accidents.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a></p>

<p>Xenophon alludes in various parts of his works to physicians or
surgeons connected with the Greek armies. In describing the laws
of the Lacedemonians, as instituted in the earliest ages of Greek
history by Lycurgus, he incidentally mentions that physicians were
attached to the Spartan army. For in the arrangements previously
laid down for the troops before a battle, it was ordered that there
should be placed behind the station occupied by the King several
officials, and among others, the soothsayers or priests, the physicians,
the minstrels, the leaders of the army, and any persons who were
voluntarily present in the expedition (&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#962;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7984;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#8054;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#945;&#8016;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#8054;, &#959;&#7985; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#8166;
&#7940;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#952;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#953; &#7968;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#8182;&#963;&#953;&#957;).</p>

<p>Again, in his celebrated account of the retreat of the ten thousand
Greeks, Xenophon states that at the conclusion of the fifth day of
their march, and after considerable skirmishing with the troops of
Tissaphernes, &#8220;they appointed eight physicians, for there were many
persons wounded.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a>&mdash;(<i>Anabasis</i>, lib. iii. c. 4, &sect; 30.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, in his semi-historical or political romance&mdash;the <i>Cyrop&aelig;dia</i>
(lib. i. 6, &sect; 15), Xenophon makes his young royal hero,
Cyrus, the founder of the Persian monarchy, speak, among other
matters, of the importance of medical officers being attached to
armies. &#8220;With respect to health&#8221; (says Cyrus), &#8220;having heard and
observed that cities that wish health choose physicians, and that
commanders, for the sake of their soldiers, take physicians; so,
when I was placed in this command, I immediately attended to
this point; and I believe that I have men with me that are very
skilful in the art of physic.&#8221; In the same work Xenophon subsequently
describes Cyrus as commending to the professional
services and care of his medical officers the Chaldeans who had
been wounded and captured in fight with him.&mdash;(<i>Instit. Cyri</i>, lib.
iii. c. 2, &sect; 12.)</p>

<p>Few individual instances are recorded in Greek history of sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>gical
aid being afforded on the field of battle. One of the most
interesting examples is that mentioned by Quintus Curtius in reference
to Alexander the Great at the taking of the capital of the
Oxydrace&aelig;, or Mallians. The Macedonian King, who had leaped
down, almost alone, within the walls of the fortress, was struck
with a long arrow (duorum cubitorum sagitta), which entered the
right side of the thorax (per thoracem paulum super latus dextrum
infigeretur). The wound produced great h&aelig;morrhage and faintness.
Alexander was carried on his shield to his tent; and the shaft of
the arrow being cut off and his cuirass removed, it was discovered
that the head of the arrow was barbed, and could not, consequently,
be removed without the artificial dilatation of the wound and imminent
danger from increased bleeding; for the large weapon was
fixed in its situation, and seemed to have penetrated into the internal
viscera (quippe ingens telum adactum erat, et penetrasse in viscera
videbatur). At Alexander&#8217;s request, the surgeon Critobulus
undertook the extraction, enlarged the wound, and removed the
arrow-head, which, according to Plutarch, was &#8220;three fingers broad
and four long.&#8221; Great h&aelig;morrhage (ingens vis sanguinis) attended
the operation; death-like insensibility supervened; and, when the
flow of blood continued in despite of the medicaments (medicamenta)
applied, a cry and wail was set up by those around, that the
king was dead. At last, however, the h&aelig;morrhage stopped, under
the state of syncope. That very syncope, observes Arrian, saved
his life; and Alexander gradually recovered. But every modern
surgeon must admire the boldness, not less than the expertness, of
Critobulus, when he reflects for a moment on the fearful peril
attendant on such an operation, performed on so august a patient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
&mdash;and at a time, too, when surgical science as yet possessed no certain
means of restraining surgical h&aelig;morrhage.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a></p>

<p class="tb">In the earlier periods of Roman history and Roman warfare, the
treatment of the military sick and wounded was, in all probability,
trusted to the casual care of some fellow-soldiers whose tastes and
inclinations had led them to pay more than usual care to the rude
surgery which existed at the time.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> As early, however, as the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>mencement
of the Christian era, we find Celsus laying down distinct,
and in many instances very excellent and practical precepts for the
extraction of war-weapons from the bodies of the wounded<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a>&mdash;as of
arrows, spears, leaden bullets (<i>glandes plumbe&aelig;</i>), etc.</p>

<p>Occasionally the weapons used in ancient war seem to have been
forged for the special purpose of rendering their extraction by the
surgeon a matter of difficulty and danger. At least we find Paulus
&AElig;gineta complaining that some of them have &#8220;their barbs diverging
in opposite directions, like the forked lightning, in order that,
whether pulled or pushed, they may fasten in the parts.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<p>Still, let me repeat, neither in Celsus nor in Paulus &AElig;gineta,
nor, indeed, in any other ancient medical work, have we, as far as
I know, any allusion to the circumstance of surgeons or physicians
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>being regularly appointed as army medical officers in the Roman
army, for the purpose of superintending the treatment of the
wounded, or&mdash;what is of still greater importance&mdash;in order to take
professional care of the soldiers disabled by sickness and disease,
and whose number in warfare is generally very much greater than
the number of those that are disabled in fight.</p>

<p>Modern military experience has, in many instances, proved the
high importance of the services and superintendence of a medical
military staff; and not so much in reference to the care of individual
cases, and the cure of the wounded, as in reference to the general
health and consequent general strength and success of whole armies.
In fact, in war the devastations produced by sickness and disease
have often been found greatly more formidable and fatal than any
devastations produced by the sword; fevers, dysenteries, and other
distempers of the camp, have carried off far more soldiers than the
ball or bayonet; malarious and morbific agency has sometimes
terminated a campaign as effectually as the highest military strategy;
and armies have occasionally, in later times, been as completely
destroyed by the indirect ravages of disease as by the direct effects
of battle.</p>

<p>Nor was the experience of the Roman armies in this respect
different from our own. When the Emperor Septimius Severus
determined to subdue the whole of Scotland, he about the year 208
led, according to Herodian and Dion Cassius,<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> an army of not less
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>than 80,000 men across the Forth, marched them north, apparently
as far as the Moray Firth, and thence returned to York. But
though in this course the Roman Emperor nowhere met the enemy
in open fight, he is stated to have lost, in this single campaign, not
less than 50,000 of his troops. The marshes, fens, woods, etc., of
Caledonia were far more destructive to the Roman invaders, than
were the spears, long swords (ingentes gladii) and scythed chariots
(corvini) of its painted, and almost naked, warriors.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<p>We know, from the oft-repeated anecdote regarding Arcagathus,
as told by Pliny, that in the early days of republican Rome the
practice of medicine was not encouraged among the inhabitants of
the Eternal City. But, in the later periods of the empire, Rome
abounded with native and foreign physicians; and, when we find
the Roman people exalted in so many branches of art and know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>ledge,
we could not but expect that common experience, and results
like that of Severus, would have suggested to them the propriety of
increasing the strength and success of their armies, by having
medical men to watch over the health of the soldiers that were
fighting in so many different regions around the Roman standards.</p>

<p class="tb">Some modern discoveries in Great Britain and elsewhere show
that such a conjecture is not at variance with truth, and that the
Roman armies were provided, at all events in the time of the Empire,
with a medical staff.</p>

<p class="tb">Housesteads, in Northumberland (the ancient Borcovicus), formed
one of the principal stations on the great defensive wall which the
Emperor Hadrian reared, in the second century, from the Tyne to
the Solway. Many Roman remains have been found at Housesteads.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a>
Thirty years ago the embellished monumental tablet, represented
in the accompanying plate, Fig. 1, was discovered among
these remains. This tablet was, according to the inscription upon
it, raised by the first Tungrian cohort to the memory of their
<span class="smcap lowercase">MEDICUS ORDINARIUS</span>.<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> The plate represents this interesting relic,
which is preserved in the Newcastle Museum. The inscription
upon the tablet reads as follows, in its contracted and in its
extended forms:&mdash;</p>

<p>And I append Mr. Brace&#8217;s translation of it:&mdash;&#8220;Sacred to the
gods of the shades below. To <span class="smcap lowercase">ANICIUS INGENUUS</span>, Physician in
Ordinary of Cohort the first of the Tungrians. He lived twenty-five
years.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a></p>

<p>The first Tungrian Cohort, which erected this monument over
the grave of their young physician, distinguished itself under Agricola
at the battle of the Mons Grampius.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> It was afterwards, as we
learn from some legionary inscriptions, engaged at Castlecary in
erecting there a portion of the more northern Roman wall of Antoninus,
which ran from the Forth to the Clyde.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> Subsequently it
was stationed at Cramond, near Edinburgh, and there raised an altar
to the <i>Matres Alaterv&aelig; et Campestres</i>.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> Still later, this Cohort was
stationed in Cumberland; and latterly at Housesteads, in Northumberland,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
where the monument we allude to, and several others,
were erected by them.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></p>

<p>The youth of this military physician is remarkable. He died
at twenty-five.</p>

<p>The elaborate nature of the carving of this monumental tablet
affords the strongest evidence of the esteem and respect in which
this young physician was held by his Cohort. In fact, it is more
ornamented than many of the altars raised by this and other
Cohorts to the worship of their gods.</p>

<p>It has been suggested by Mr. O&#8217;Callaghan<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> that the animal represented
on the monument is a hare, and that it was selected as
an emblem characteristic of the watchfulness of the profession to
which <span class="smcap lowercase">ANICIUS INGENUUS</span> belonged. In his admirable work on the
Roman Wall, the Rev. Mr. Bruce describes, more correctly, the
figure to be that of a rabbit; and he further conjectures that it had
some reference to the worship of Priapus. The whole device is, in
all probability, far more simple in its signification. The <i>cuniculus</i>,
or rabbit, when found on ancient Roman monuments and coins, is
generally held by arch&aelig;ologists and numismatists as the recognised
emblem of Spain,<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> as, for example, on the coins of Sextus Pompey
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>and Galba; and the circular bucklers or cetr&aelig; which are placed on
this tablet, on either side of the animal, are equally strong characteristics
of the same country. Indeed, there can be little or no
doubt that these devices indicate merely that this young military
physician was of Spanish birth and origin.</p>

<p>Several monumental and votive tablets have been discovered in
other parts of the old Roman world, affording further evidence of the
Roman troops being provided with a medical staff. In Gruter&#8217;s
great work on Roman inscriptions there are copies of at least three
inscriptions, in which physicians of Cohorts (<i>medici cohortum</i>) are
mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> One of these inscriptions (p. 219, 3) bears the name
of a physician who had the same <i>nomen gentilicium</i> as the medical
officer of the Tungrian Cohort who died at Housesteads&mdash;viz., &#8220;<span class="smcap lowercase">M.
JULIUS INGENUUS MEDIC. COH. II. VIG.</span>&#8221; The tablet, which was found
at Rome, contains a votive imperial inscription from twelve or thirteen
persons, and among others, from the physician to the second
&#8220;Cohors Vigilum.&#8221; Another of the inscriptions of Gruter is specially
interesting in relation to its date, for it was cut at the commencement
of the reign of Domitian,<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> and in the year of the consulship
of F. Flavius Sabinus, which year chronologists know to
have been the eighty-third of the Christian era. We are, consequently,
afforded evidence by this inscription that before the end
of the first century, at least&mdash;however much earlier&mdash;medical
officers were appointed to the Cohorts of the Roman army. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>inscription itself is upon an altar or votive tablet, dedicated by
<span class="smcap lowercase">SEXTUS TITUS ALEXANDER</span>, physician of the fifth Pr&aelig;torian Cohort, to
&AElig;sculapius, and the safety of his fellow-soldiers. A copy of this
altar and its inscription is given in the accompanying plate, Fig. 2.
The stone seems to have been found at Rome.</p>

<p>Another altar, discovered also at Rome, and inscribed in the
same terms to &AElig;sculapius, is given by Gruter (p. 68, 2). In this
instance, the dedicator is <span class="smcap lowercase">SEXTUS TITIUS</span>, medical officer to the sixth
Pr&aelig;torian Cohort; and he erects it for the health of the fellow-soldiers
of his Cohort, in conformity with a vow which he had
undertaken. The whole inscription is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Muratori, in his Thesaurus,<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> cites a Roman sepulchral tablet discovered
at Veterbi, and containing an inscription by a father to his
deceased son, <span class="smcap lowercase">M. VLPIUS SPORUS</span>, Physician to the Indian and Asturian
Auxiliaries (Medico Alarum Indianae et tertiae Asturum).<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>The tablets to which I have hitherto alluded all refer, with the
doubtful exception of the first and last, to one rank of medical
military men, namely the surgeons of cohorts (<i>Medici Cohortum</i>).
It is generally believed that each cohort consisted of about 500 or
600 men; though this appears to have varied at different times.
From the preceding tablets, each cohort seems to have been provided
with at least one medical officer, if not more. For the distinctive
terms &#8220;Ordinarius&#8221; and &#8220;Clinicus,&#8221; which occur in the first and
last of the preceding inscriptions, when added to the usual term
&#8220;Medicus Cohortis,&#8221; apparently tend to indicate a different grade
or rank of medical officer from the latter.</p>

<p>Whether, however, or not there were different grades among the
Roman <i>Medici Cohortum</i>, we have sufficient evidence for proving
that there existed in the Roman army a higher rank of medical
officer than these,&mdash;namely, <i>Medici Legionum</i>. The Roman legion
consisted of ten cohorts.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> We have seen that the individual cohorts
of which the legion was composed were each provided with a medical
officer or officers. I have already cited a law from Justinian&#8217;s
Codex, showing further that there were military physicians to the
Roman legions. The evidence of monumental tablets affords
additional proof, that over the whole legion, another, and in all
probability a superior medical officer, was placed. More than
one monumental tablet has been discovered, dedicated not to the
<i>Medicus Cohortis</i>, but to the <i>Medicus Legioni</i>. Thus Maffei, in his
<i>Museum Veronense</i>, gives the inscription of a tablet raised by Scribonia
Faustina to the manes of her very dear husband, <span class="smcap lowercase">L C&AElig;LIUS
ARRIANUS</span>, physician to the Second Italian Legion, who died at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>the age of forty-nine years and seven months. The inscription in
the original runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the <i>Collectio Inscriptionum</i> (vol. i. No. 448) of Hugenbach
and Orelli, there is published another Roman tablet found in
Switzerland (at Gebistorf, near Windisch), bearing the name of a
Legionary physician. The inscription states that Atticus Patronus
erected this tablet to <span class="smcap lowercase">TITUS CLAUDIUS HYMNUS</span>, physician to the

<p>Orelli gives in the same work (vol. ii. No. 4996), another tablet
found at Salon, in which a third physician to a legion is named;
the tablet being erected by <span class="smcap lowercase">M. BESIUS TERTULLUS</span>, physician of the
eleventh Legion, to the memory of his &#8220;hospes,&#8221; Papiria Pyrallis.</p>

<p>I have already alluded to a passage in Vegetius, showing in
relation to the government of the Roman medical staff, that the
medical officers as well as their patients were both placed under the
control of the Pr&aelig;fect of the Camp, to whose multifarious duties,
these, among other matters, pertained. &#8220;Praeterea aegri contubernales,
et medici a quibus curantur, expensae etiam ad ejus industriam
pertinebant.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> Vegetius does not allude to the existence of
any special sick quarters; but a writer of the second century, who
lived under Trajan and Hadrian, Hyginus Gromaticus, in his essay
&#8220;De Castrametatione,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> in laying down the proportions and measurements
of the different parts of a Roman camp, describes the proper
situation in it for the Hospital or &#8220;Valetudinarium.&#8221; This observation
of Hyginus is interesting as far as regards the probable date of
the first institution of camp hospitals; for we have no allusion to
them in Polybius&#8217; earlier account of the different points and parts
of a Roman camp of his day; and even in the first century of our
era, when Tacitus describes Germanicus as visiting and encouraging
the wounded soldiers under his command, he uses such an expres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>sion,
&#8220;circumire saucios&#8221;as to lead to the supposition, that the
invalids in the Roman camp were still, like the old Homeric heroes,
laid up in their own tents.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> Indeed, Lampridius speaks of the
Emperor Alexander Severus in the third century, still visiting his
sick soldiers in their tents (aegrotantes ipse visitavit per tentoria
milites).<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> Let me add, that medical stores appear, as we might expect,
to have been carried with the imperial armies. At least in the war
conducted by Germanicus against Arminius, we are told by Tacitus,
that in one of their contests with the German army, the Roman
troops lost their intrenching tools, tents, and remedies or dressings
for the wounded (fomenta sauciis);<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> and subsequently we find
Agrippina the wife of the Roman general, distributing gratuitously
among the soldiers, clothes to the needy, and dressings to the
wounded (militibusque, ut quis inops aut saucius, vestem et fomenta
dilargita est).<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> We have the transport of the wounded sick sometimes
spoken of; as, for example, when Tempanius leads back his victorious
troops from the Volscian war;<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> but the only instance in which,
as far as I remember, any special description of ambulance is mentioned,
occurs in Hirtius&#8217; <i>Commentaries</i>, where he tells us that, after
the battle fought near Ruspina, Labienus ordered his wounded to be
carried to Adrumentum, bound in waggons (saucios suos jubet in
plostris deligatos Adrumentum deportari).<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> The passage should
more probably read &#8220;plostris decubitos.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>

<p>The remarks which I have hitherto made refer only to the medical
staff and organisation of the Roman army. If, however, as the
preceding facts tend to show, the Roman troops were furnished
with a medical staff, there is, <i>a priori</i>, every probability that the
Roman fleet was similarly provided. The contingencies, however,
of a naval, as compared with a military life, render the preservation
of such monumental proofs as we have already adduced in relation
to the existence of army medical officers much less likely in relation
to the existence of medical officers in the fleet. Indeed I am
only aware of the discovery of one ancient tablet referring to the
naval medical service. In his late splendid work on the Latin inscriptions
found in the kingdom of Naples, Mommsen has given a
careful copy of the tablet in question.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> The inscription upon it was
first, I believe, published by Marini.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> The tablet itself, which is
now placed in the antiquarian collection at Dresden, was originally
discovered in the Elysian fields, near Bai&aelig;; and consequently in
the vicinity of the famous <i>Pontus Julius</i>, and the station of the imperial
Misenian fleet. The inscription on the stone bears that <span class="smcap">M.</span></p>

<p>In the preceding inscription <span class="smcap lowercase">LONGINUS</span> is designated <i>Medicus
Duplicarius</i>; the term duplicarius in this as other inscriptions
signifying that, by the length or superiority of his service, he was
entitled to double pay and rewards. The &#8220;duplex stupendium&#8221;
and &#8220;duplex frumentum&#8221; is repeatedly alluded to by Varro, Livy,
Virgil, and other classical authors, as a military reward accorded to
the more deserving soldiers and officers of the army; and the
corresponding adjective &#8220;<i>duplicarius</i>&#8221; not unfrequently occurs in
old Roman inscriptions.</p>

<p class="tb">In a previous page it has been stated that nowhere in the Roman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>classics does there exist any distinct allusion to physicians or
surgeons as forming a regular part of the staff of the Roman army.
There are several references, however, in ancient medical and
classical authors to the fact of medical men being placed in professional
attendance upon Roman Senators,<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> Consuls,<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> and Emperors
during the course of their military campaigns. Thus Galen tells us
that he himself was summoned in this last capacity to attend upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>the Emperors M. Aurelius and L. Verus at Apuleia during their proposed
campaign against some of the German tribes.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a></p>

<p>Various fragmentary notices exist regarding the physicians who
attended upon those Roman Emperors who visited Britain. A medical
author (whom Galen often quotes), Scribonius Largus, has left a
valued therapeutical work, <i>De Compositione Medicamentorum</i>. This
work was written, as we are informed in the preface to it, when the
author was absent from Rome, and deprived of the greater part
of his library. In his <i>History of Medicine</i>, Sprengel states, but I
know not on what precise authority, that the work in question was
composed by Largus when he was absent with the Emperor Claudius
during his short campaign into England.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> Our countryman, Sir
Thomas Browne, makes a similar statement. In his <i>Hydriotaphia</i>,
when discoursing on the want of Roman notices regarding the state,
habits, etc., of the ancient Britons, he observes, &#8220;We much deplore
the loss of that letter which Cicero expected or received from his
brother Quintus, as a resolution of British customs; or the accounts
which might have been made by Scribonius Largus, the physician
accompanying the Emperor Claudius, who might have discovered
that frugal bit of the old Britons (mentioned by Dion) which, in the
bigness of a bean, could satisfy their hunger.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a></p>

<p>We have already had occasion to allude to the disasters which
attended the Scottish campaign of Severus, and to the imperfect
health of the emperor himself during his invasion of Scotland. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>evidence of Herodian further shows us that during it he was
attended by his own physicians, and that their conduct after the
emperor&#8217;s return from Scotland to York, whilst in the highest degree
commendable as regards their faith and duty to the emperor, proved
the cause of their own downfall and destruction. The anxiety of
Caracalla for the death of his father Severus is well known. We
have the testimony of Herodian to the fact, that while the father
and son were living at York, Caracalla at one time attempted to
destroy his father with his own hand. The same historian further
informs us, that the unhappy son attempted to induce the medical
attendants of Severus to adopt means to hasten the emperor&#8217;s death.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a>
He adds further, that in consequence of the court physicians not
complying with his unrighteous request, Caracalla, immediately
after the demise of Severus, commenced his reign of bloodshed
and terror by putting to death these recusant physicians of the
late emperor.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>In the retrospect, it affords a strange subject of meditation for
us in the nineteenth century, to consider that, some fifteen hundred
years ago, it thus happened in England, that a number of physicians
were themselves doomed to death for refusing to pervert their professional
trust so far as to become the murderers of the royal invalid
who had confided his health to their care. And the modern physician
may look back with some degree of pride upon the fact, that
in an age and at a court where cruelty and corruption held unrestrained
sway, some members of the medical profession at least
remained so uncorruptible as to endanger and sacrifice their own
lives rather than tamper with the life of their patient.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a></p>

<h2>ANCIENT ROMAN MEDICINE-STAMPS.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>SECTION I.</h3>

<p class="center3">INTRODUCTORY REMARKS ON THE DISCOVERY, CHARACTERS, ETC.,
OF ROMAN MEDICINE STAMPS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> two hundred years ago there were found at Nymegen, in
Holland, two small, greenish, flat, square-shaped stones or tablets,
each engraved on its four lateral surfaces or edges with inscriptions,
the letters of which were cut incuse and retrograde. In his work on
the Roman and other antiquities of Nymegen,<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> Schmidt, one of the
greatest arch&aelig;ologists of his day, described these two stones; but
he confessedly altogether failed in interpreting their nature and uses,
or in reading the legends inscribed upon them.</p>

<p>A few years later, another distinguished Dutch antiquary, Spon
of Leyden, published an account of a third tablet, similar in character
to the two described by Schmidt;<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> and he suggested that they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>were engraved stones, which the ancient pharmacopolists used as
lids for covering the jars or boxes in which their ointments, oils,
or collyria were kept.<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a></p>

<p>Subsequently, during the currency of the last century, Chishull,<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a>
Caylus,<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> Walch,<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> Saxe,<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> and Gough,<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> published accounts of various
other stones, analogous in their character to the two first discovered
at Nymegen. And, through the labours and interpretations of these
and other authors, it came at last to be generally admitted among
antiquaries, that the nature of the legends upon the stones in question,&mdash;the
incuse and retrograde form of their inscriptions,&mdash;and the localities
in which they were found, all proved them to be medicine-stamps,
employed for the purpose of marking their drugs, by the Roman
doctors, who (some sixteen or seventeen centuries ago) practised at
the various stations throughout Europe, that were in those olden
times occupied by the colonists and soldiers of Rome. Latterly,
since the beginning of the present century, various additional
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>examples of similar Roman medicine-stamps have been discovered
at different old Roman towns and stations in France, Germany,
etc., and described by Tochon,<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> Sichel,<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> Duchalais,<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> Dufour,<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> and
others.</p>

<p>These Roman medicine-stamps all agree in their general characters.
They usually consist of small quadrilateral or oblong pieces,
of a greenish schist and steatite, engraved on one or more of their
edges or borders. The inscriptions are in small capital Roman letters,
cut retrograde and intagliate (like the letters on modern seals
and stamps), and consequently reading on the stone itself from right
to left, but making an impression, when stamped upon wax or any
other similar plastic material, which reads from left to right. The
inscriptions themselves generally first contain (and that repeated
on each side) the name of the medical practitioner to whom the
stamp pertained; then the name of some special medicine, or medical
formula; and, lastly, the disease or diseases for which that medicine
was prescribed. In a few instances, the modes and frequency
of using the medicine are added. In some instances, the designation
of the medicine, and of the disease for which it is intended, are
alone given. Perhaps still more frequently, when the number of
items is limited, the name of the medical practitioner only appears,
along with the name of some special medicinal preparation or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>remedy prepared or sold by him. And sometimes the stamps present
merely the appellation of the medicine alone, without either the
name of the practitioner who vended it, or the name of the disease
against which it was supposed to be efficacious.</p>

<p>To this brief description one more curious fact remains to be
added,&mdash;namely, that in almost all, if not in all, the Roman medicine-stamps
hitherto discovered, the medicines inscribed upon them
are drugs for affections of the eye and its appendages; and the
diseases, when specified upon them, are always ophthalmic diseases.
Hence it may, with great probability, be concluded, that either
these stamps were used by oculists alone, or they were used by the
general medical practitioner in marking his eye-medicines only.
On this account some authors have not inaptly described them under
the special designation of Roman Ophthalmic or Oculist stamps.</p>

<p>The number of the stamps that have already been discovered
amply proves that ophthalmic diseases must have been extremely
frequent in the sites of the old Roman colonies spread throughout
western Europe; and although only three such oculist-stamps are
as yet described as having been found within the confines of Italy
itself,<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> yet the frequent references to individual oculists at Rome by
Celsus, Galen, and others, and the elaborate descriptions of eye-diseases
left us by the various Greek and Roman medical authors,
who practised in the Eternal City during the time of the empire,
alike testify to the fact, that these diseases were also sufficiently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>common in the Roman capital, and that many of the fellow-citizens
of Horace could probably personally apply the well-known description
which the poet gives of himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Hic oculis ego nigra meis Collyria lippus</div>
<div class="line">Illinere.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Galen, Celsus, &AElig;tius, Paulus &AElig;gineta, etc., all describe the
different diseases of the eye with care and minuteness; and the
Roman practitioners had evidently studied these affections, and their
specific distinctions, with no small degree of attention. In modern
times medical literature has been enriched with more complete and
elaborate monographs upon the diseases of the eye, than upon the
diseases of any other single organ of the body. But, perhaps, few
of these monographs describe a larger number of ophthalmic diseases
than was professed to be known and discriminated in those
distant times when Galen wrote and practised. This author, in the
16th chapter of his book, entitled <i>Introductio seu Medicus</i> enumerates
and defines nosologically not less than one hundred and
twenty-four diseases to which the eye and its appendages are liable.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a></p>

<p>In the management of these diseases of the eye, the Roman
practitioners used, as we shall afterwards see, bleeding, antiphlogistics,
scarification, and other appropriate constitutional and local
treatment. But the practical part of their treatises, referring to
ophthalmic affections, is specially loaded with collyria&mdash;professedly
of use in almost every stage of every disease of the eye.<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> Galen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>speaks of Asclepiades describing in his works a plentiful forest
of collyria (<i>collyriorum silva</i>).<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> In his book, <i>De Compositione
Medicamentorum secundum Locos</i>, Galen has himself left us formul&aelig;
for upwards of two hundred of the ancient collyria. &AElig;tius
gives as great, if not a greater number. The &#8220;Opus de Compositione
Medicamentorum&#8221; of Myrepsus contains recipes for eighty-seven
ophthalmic collyria; and the works of Scribonius Largus,
Celsus, Actuarius, Oribasius, Alexander Trallianus, Marcellus,
Paulus &AElig;gineta, etc., present us with abundance of formul&aelig; for
the same class of preparations.</p>

<p>These collyria were composed of very various,<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> and in some instances
of very numerous, ingredients. But most of them which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>had attained any great degree of reputation, seem (like the compound
formul&aelig;, or prescriptions in our modern pharmacop&oelig;ias), to
have each passed under a short specific name, by which they were
no doubt readily and generally recognised by the profession, and
perhaps also by the public, in those ancient times. The specific
appellations of the individual collyria were derived from different
sources.</p>

<p>Some of them were known under the names of the oculists who
invented or employed them. Thus Galen gives recipes for the
collyria of Asclepiades, of Philoxenis, of Capiton, of Zoilus, of Cassius,
of Sosandrus, of Phaedrus, of Syneros, of Hermeius, of Erasistratus,
of Marcus, of Antonius Musa; the collyrium of Sergius,
the Babylonian oculist; the collyrium of Philip of C&aelig;sarea; and
many others.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> Occasionally the appellation under which the collyria
were known was derived from some of their more marked physical
properties, as the &#8220;collyrium <i>Chloron</i> appellatum,&#8221; from the green
colour of the preparation; the <i>Cirrhon</i>, from its yellowish tint; <i>Euchron</i>,
from its agreeable hue (a colore bono dictum); the collyrium
<i>Cygnus</i>, from its white or swan-like hue;<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> the <i>Aromaticum</i>, from
its pleasant odour; and so forth. One or other of the principal
ingredients entering into its composition seems to have given the
name under which other collyria were known, as the <i>Nardinum</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>from its containing spikenard; the collyrium <i>Diasmyrnes</i> (&#948;&#953;&#945;, with,
and &#963;&#956;&#965;&#961;&#957;&#945;, myrrh), from its containing myrrh; the <i>Diarrhodon</i>,
from its containing roses, etc. Occasionally the collyrium seems to
have derived its name and fame from some great person whom it
had been fortunate enough to benefit or to cure. Thus, for example,
Galen gives a recipe for the collyrium which Phlorus used in the case
of Antonia, the mother of Drusus; for the &#8220;<i>collyrium Harmatium</i>,&#8221;
which King Ptolemy used, etc. One was termed <i>Achariston</i>, from its
cheapness; and this collyrium repeatedly occurs on the oculist-seals.
Another was termed <i>Atimeton</i>, from its supposed great value. But
perhaps the most common mode of appellation was the use of some
recommendatory name, advertising the supposed high qualities of
the drug. Thus the old Greek and Roman authors give various
species of the collyrium <i>Monohemeron</i>,&mdash;so named from its being
alleged to effect a cure in a single day; others are designated the
<i>Miraculum</i>, the <i>Mysterium</i>, the Nectar collyrium (<i>Nectarium</i>); the
Royal (<i>Collyrium Basilicon</i>); the Royal Indian (<i>Collyrium Indicum
Regale</i>); the gold-like (<i>Isochryson</i>); the divine (<i>Isotheon</i>), etc. etc.
And lastly, a collyrium was often known under some high-sounding
but unmeaning name, such as the collyrium <i>Olympus</i>, <i>Proteus</i>,
<i>Ph&oelig;nix</i>, <i>Phyon</i>, <i>Sph&aelig;rion</i>, <i>Philadelphium</i>, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Under such designations the principal collyria of the Roman
oculists were known and used (like the one invented and boasted of
by Galen) &#8220;per omnes gentes quibus imperant Romani;&#8221; and it is
under such special appellations that we find these different collyria
mentioned in the inscriptions engraved upon the old oculist-stamps,
which have been turned up among the ruins of their ancient colonial
stations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>Above sixty Roman oculist-stamps have now been discovered in
different parts of Western Europe, but particularly in Germany,
France, and Holland. Some time ago one was found about ten
miles east of Edinburgh; and it is principally with the view of
describing this, and along with it the other specimens that have
been detected in the British Islands, that I have ventured to draw
up the present imperfect essay. I have been the more induced to
do so because this Scottish stamp is remarkable, both as being
found on almost the very frontier of the ancient Roman empire,
and as being one of the most perfect yet discovered. Besides, I
entertain a strong hope that such a publication as the present may
perhaps be fortunate enough to lead, through the zeal of some
members of the profession, to the detection in this country of additional
examples of these curious remains of our Roman medical
predecessors.</p>

<p>In treating, in the following sections, of the individual Roman
medicine-stamps that have been found in Great Britain, I shall
begin with some account, first, of the specimen found at Tranent,
and of two other undescribed specimens contained in the British
Museum. Afterwards I shall notice the other similar stones or
tablets that have been hitherto brought to light in these islands, in
an order chronologically in reference to the dates at which they severally
happened to be rediscovered in those localities in which they
had lain concealed and buried for many a long century. And lastly,
I shall attempt to offer some general remarks upon the probable
uses of the medicine-stamps; the nature of the drugs and the character
of the diseases mentioned upon them; the names, status, and
residences of their proprietors; and various other correlative points.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<h3>SECTION II.</h3>

<p class="center3">STAMP NO. I.&mdash;FOUND AT TRANENT.</p>

<p>The Scottish specimen of Roman medicine-stamp, to which I
have adverted in the preceding page, was discovered some years ago
at Tranent in East Lothian, not far distant from the old, and doubtlessly
in former times extensive, Roman settlement or <i>Municipium</i>
at Inveresk.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> The stamp now belongs to the Museum of the
Society of Scottish Antiquaries.</p>

<p>It was presented to the Museum by the late Mr. Drummond Hay,
formerly one of the Secretaries of the Society. From Mr. Hay&#8217;s
notes it appears that it was found amid a quantity of broken tiles,
brick, and other debris of an old (and probably Roman) house, near
the church of Tranent. For many years after being deposited in
the Antiquarian Museum its character remained undiscovered, till
the present excellent Secretary of the Society, my esteemed friend
Mr. Daniel Wilson, was led, in reading the descriptions of other
similar stamps, to ascertain its true character.</p>

<p>The stamp itself is, as usual, formed out of a greenish-coloured
steatite. The stone is of the figure of a parallelogram, nearly two
and a half inches in length, and with inscriptions cut upon two
of its sides. There is a roundish projection at either extremity of
the stone, as seen in the accompanying lithograph (Plate I., No. I.,
Figs. 1, 2, 3), where the stone and letters of the two inscriptions
are, in every respect, faithfully copied from the original as to form
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>and size. The letters are, as in all other similar medicine-stamps,
cut incuse and reversed, so as to read from left to right when the
inscription was stamped upon any impressible material. Fig. 2
shows one of the inscriptions as it appears cut intagliate upon the
stone. Fig. 3 presents an accurate copy of this inscription as it is
seen when stamped upon wax. Fig. 1 is an equally faithful copy
of the second inscription placed on the opposite side of the stone.
It will be observed that, as in the original, the size of the lettering
varies on the two sides.</p>

<p>The lettering on the two sides (1 and 2) runs thus, as it stands
inscribed upon the stone:&mdash;</p>

<div class="line">2. LVALLATINIAPALOCRO</div>
<div class="line i1">CODESADDIATHESIS</div>

<p>The two inscriptions read as follows, when we separate the individual
words composing them from each other:&mdash;</p>

<div class="line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">2. L VALLATINI APALOCRO-</div>
<div class="line i1">CODES AD DIATHESIS.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Let us endeavour to interpret each of these inscriptions in
detail, supplying the elisions and contractions which exist in
almost all Roman inscriptions; but which are less in this seal
than in most others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">L</span>(<i>ucii?</i>) <span class="smcap lowercase">VALLATINI EVODES AD CICATRICES ET ASP</span><i>e</i><span class="smcap lowercase">RITUDIN</span><i>es</i>.&mdash;<i>Lucius
Vallatinus&#8217; Evodes for cicatrices and granulations.</i></p>

<p>Several of the collyria derived, as I have already observed, their
designation from some special physical character. The present instance
is an example in point, the appellation <i>Evodes</i> (&#949;&#8016;&#8061;&#948;&#949;&#962;) being
derived from the pleasant odour (&#949;&#8016;, well, and &#8004;&#950;&#969;, I smell) of the
composition. Marcellus, in his work <i>De Medicamentis</i>, specially
praises the collyrium known under the name of <i>Evodes</i>; and that
too in the class of eye-diseases mentioned on the Tranent seal.
For, in his collection of remedies for removing ulcers, cicatrices,
etc., of the eyes and eyelids, he recommends (to use his own words)
&#8220;pr&aelig;cipue hoc quod quidam Diasmyrnon, nonnulli <i>Evodes</i>, quia
boni odoris est, nominant.&#8221; And he directs the <i>Evodes</i> to be dissolved
and diluted in water, and introduced into the eyes with a
probe, or after inverting the eyelid, when it was used with the view
of extenuating recent cicatrices of the eyes, and removing granulations
of the eyelids,&mdash;&#8220;ex aqua autem ad cicatrices recentes
extenuendas, et palpebrarum asperitudinem tollendam teri debet,
et subjecto specillo aut inversa palpebra, oculis inseri.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a></p>

<p>Scribonius Largus had previously described, in nearly the same
words, the collyrium,&mdash;&#8220;quod quidam &#949;&#8016;&#8061;&#948;&#949;&#962; vocant,&#8221; and its uses
in recent cicatrices and granulations, etc. Both these authors give
the same recipe for the composition of the <i>Evodes</i>,&mdash;viz. pompholyx,
burnt copper, saffron, myrrh, hematites, opium, and other
ingredients, rubbed down in Chian wine. Its agreeable odour was
probably owing to a considerable quantity of spikenard being used
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>in its composition.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> Galen gives two other collyria, of a different
composition, and for other affections, as known at his time under
the same name of <i>Evodes</i>,&mdash;the one termed the &#8220;<i>Evodes</i> of Zosimus,&#8221;
the other the &#8220;diasmyrnon <i>Evodes</i> of Syneros.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a></p>

<p>2. L. VALLATINI APALOCROCODES AD DIATHESIS.&mdash;<i>L. Vallatinus'
mild Crocodes for affections of the eyes.</i></p>

<p>The term diathesis in this inscription is used in a different sense
from that in which we now employ the same word in modern
medicine. At the present day we apply the term diathesis to
designate the tendency or predisposition to some special disease, or
class of diseases. In the times of the Roman physicians, it was
often used as synonymous with disease itself; and in the Latin
translations of the Greek texts of Galen, Aetius, etc., it is hence
rendered usually by the general word &#8220;affectus,&#8221; &#8220;affectio,&#8221; etc.
The first sentence in Paulus &AElig;gineta&#8217;s chapter on Ophthalmic
Diseases, affords an instance in point: &#8220;Quum dolores vehementiores
in oculis fiunt, considera ex quanam affectione (&#948;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#949;&#953;) oculum
dolere contingit.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> Thus, also, the <i>Evodes</i> of Zosimus (to which I
have before alluded) is entered by Galen as a remedy simply against
&#8220;dolores et recentes affectus,&#8221; according to the Latin translation of
K&uuml;hn,&mdash;&#8220;&#960;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#969;&#948;&#965;&#957;&#953;&#945;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#953; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#966;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;,&#8221; according to the
original Greek text. He uses diathesis, in fact, as a general term for
eye-diseases. Thus, when speaking of diseases of the eye in general,
he observes,&mdash;&#8220;Scripsi omnia qu&aelig; necesse est Medicum de oculorum
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>affectibus (&#948;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#957;) nosse.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> In its last syllable in the inscription
on the seal, diathes<span class="smcap lowercase">IS</span> stands instead of the Roman accusative
diathes<span class="smcap lowercase">ES</span>, or the Greek accusative diathes<span class="smcap lowercase">EIS</span>. This usage, however,
is not without classical authority.</p>

<p>The collyrium mentioned in the prescription (the <i>Crocodes</i>)
derives its designation from its containing the crocus, or saffron, as
one of its principal ingredients.</p>

<p>In describing the therapeutic effects of the crocus, Dioscorides
mentions, as its first special use, its efficacy in &#8220;fluxions of the
eyes&#8221;&mdash;(oculorum fluxiones cohibet).<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></p>

<p>Pliny, in enumerating the qualities of the crocus, begins by
observing that it has a discutient effect upon all inflammations,
but chiefly on those of the eyes (discutit inflammationes omnes
quidem, sed oculorum maxime); and in speaking of its combinations
he tells us that it has given a name to one collyrium (collyrio
uno etiam nomen dedit).<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> But it entered into the composition of
very many of the ancient eye-medicines, and more than one of these
passed under the name of <i>Crocodes</i>, as in the inscription on the seal.
Galen, in his list of eye-remedies, gives the recipe for the composition
of a <i>Crocodes</i> collyrium for epiphor&aelig;, pains, and affections
(&#948;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;) from wounds of the eye.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> He discusses the composition
also of the aromatic <i>Crocodes</i> of Heraclides, and the oxydercic <i>Crocodes</i>
of Asclepius, etc.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> When describing, in another part, the
remedies for ulcers of the eyes, he mentions a collyrium containing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>crocus, and adds, &#8220;habet autem hoc plurimum in se crocum, unde
etiam <i>Croceum</i> (&#954;&#961;&#959;&#954;&#969;&#948;&#949;&#962;) appellatur.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></p>

<p>Celsus,<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> Alexander Trallianus,<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> and Paulus &AElig;gineta<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> give recipes
for eye collyria, under the name of diacrocus (&#948;&#953;&#945; &#954;&#961;&#959;&#954;&#959;&#962;).</p>

<p>I have not yet alluded to the expression <span class="smcap lowercase">APALO</span>, standing before
<i>Crocodes</i>. This expression presents the only difficulty in reading
the inscription; and various suggestions might be offered in regard
to its explanation. But it seems most probable that it was used as
a qualifying term to the <i>Crocodes</i>. Several of the collyria have the
Latin adjective &#8220;lene,&#8221; and &#8220;leve,&#8221; placed before them, in order to
certify their mild nature. Scribonius Largus gives a whole division
of collyria, headed &#8220;Collyria composita levia.&#8221; Aetius has a chapter,
&#8220;De Lenibus Collyriis.&#8221; The expression <i>apalo</i>, as a part and
prefix to <i>Crocodes</i>, would seem to indicate the same quality in the
crocodes sold by Vallatinus, the term being in all likelihood derived
from the Greek adjective &#945;&#960;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#962;, or the corresponding Latin adjective
<i>apalus</i> (mild, soft). Homer frequently uses the word as signifying
soft, delicate, and especially as applied to different parts of
the body (see <i>Iliad</i>, book iii. 371; xvii. 123, etc.); and, indeed, both
Aetius and Paulus &AElig;gineta employ the Greek adjective therapeutically
in the sense of mild, and as applied to collyria. In the treatment
of acute inflammatory ulcers of the eye, after inculcating the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>usual antiphlogistic treatment, Aetius adds, &#8220;collyria vero tenera
(&#945;&#960;&#945;&#955;&#945;) ulcerate oculo infundantur.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a></p>

<p>When treating of carbuncles and carcinoma of the eye, Paulus
&AElig;gineta observes that the affection may be alleviated &#8220;by the
injection of soothing (<i>tenera</i>, &#945;&#960;&#945;&#955;&#945;) collyria, such as the <i>Spodiacum</i>,
<i>Severianum</i>, and the like.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> And again, when giving his formul&aelig;
for different collyria in another part of his works, he applies the
term &#945;&#960;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#957; to the collyrium <i>Diathalium</i>, or collyrium made from
olive leaves (&#916;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#945;&#960;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#957;), upon the same principle, and evidently
with the same signification, as the word is used in the
Tranent stamp, as applied to the collyrium <i>Crocodes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></p>

<p class="tb">I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Birch for the impressions
of two unpublished oculist-stamps, contained in the British Museum.
Their forms and inscriptions are represented in Plate I.,
Nos. II. and III.; and I shall describe them under these numbers.
They are supposed to have formed part of the collection of Sir
Hans Sloane; but no note exists as to the precise locality in which
they were discovered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<h3>SECTION III.</h3>

<p class="center3">STAMP NO. II.&mdash;CONTAINED IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM.</p>

<p>This large stamp consists (Plate I., No. II.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a>) of a flat quadrilateral
stone, about an inch and a half broad, and engraved upon three
of its sides. A portion of one corner of the stone is broken off.
The probable deficiency which is thus produced in one of the inscriptions
is supplied in this, and in some other similar instances
in the sequel, by Italic letters. The three inscriptions read as
follow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">1. SEX: JUL: SEDATI</div>
<div class="line i1">CROCOD PACCIAN</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">2. SEX: JUL: SEDATI CRO-</div>
<div class="line i1">CODES DIALEPIDOS</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">3. (<i>Sex</i>): JUL: SEDATI CRO-</div>
<div class="line i1">(<i>cod</i>)ES AD DIATHES</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The name of the oculist&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sextus Julius Sedatus</span>&mdash;is imperfect
on the third or broken side, the pr&aelig;nomen &#8220;<span class="smcap lowercase">SEX</span>&#8221; being wanting
on that side in the first line, and the middle syllable &#8220;<span class="smcap lowercase">COD</span>&#8221; of
the word Crocodes being also wanting, from the same cause, in the
second line.</p>

<p>The restored reading of this third side&mdash;viz., <span class="smcap">sexti julii sedati
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
crocodes ad diathes</span><i>es</i>&mdash;need not be dwelt upon, as it is so very
similar to that on one side of the Tranent stone. The other two
sides contain the names of two new varieties of crocodes.</p>

<p>One of these varieties&mdash;the <span class="smcap lowercase">CROCODES PACCIANUM</span>&mdash;received its
name from Paccius, a celebrated Roman medical practitioner, who
either invented this special collyrium, or brought it into repute.
Paccius, who lived about the commencement of the Christian era,
is said to have amassed a fortune by the sale of a secret nostrum.
At his death he bequeathed the prescription for it to the Emperor
Tiberius, who placed a copy of it in the various public libraries.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a>
In the list of his ophthalmic medicines, Galen gives formul&aelig; for
various collyria invented by Paccius, such as the &#8220;<i>Sphragis Paccii</i>,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a>
&#8220;<i>Asclepiadeum Paccii</i>,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> &#8220;<i>Collyrium</i> ex terra Samia <i>Paccii
Ophthalmici</i> ad affectus intensos (&#949;&#960;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;&#962; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;).&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> Galen
does not give any recipe for the <i>Crocodes</i> of Paccius; but it was
evidently a collyrium duly esteemed at the time in which he
wrote; for, in his chapter on ulcers of the eyes, he specially names
the &#8220;<span class="smcap lowercase">CROCODES PACCIANUM</span>,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> and recommends its use in cases in
which the accompanying inflammation has already ceased, and at
the stage when a stimulating application becomes necessary.</p>

<p>The other variety of crocodes used by Sedatus is the <span class="smcap lowercase">CROCODES
DIALEPIDOS</span>. A formula for <i>Dialepidos</i> is given by Marcellus,<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> with
the crocus as the first ingredient mentioned in its composition. The
<i>Dialepidos</i> derived its name from its containing the scales&mdash;(&#955;&#949;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#962;)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>of burnt copper, or the black peroxide of that metal,&mdash;a preparation
which Dioscorides (lib. v. cap. 89) describes as useful in eye-diseases;
and which Galen declares to be a &#8220;medicamentum multo
utilissimum,&#8221; vol. xii. p. 223.</p>

<h3>SECTION IV.</h3>

<p class="center3">STAMP NO. III.&mdash;CONTAINED IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM.</p>

<p>A second Roman medicine-stamp is (as I have already stated,
p. 244) contained in the British Museum. The stone is small and
broken, and only engraved on one side (see Plate I., No. III.)
The inscription does not include, as usual, the name of the oculist
who possessed and employed it.</p>

<p>The lettering on this stamp is very distinct, except in one particular.
It is doubtful whether the third last letter is intended for
an &#8220;L,&#8221; or stands, as suggested by Mr. Way, for an &#8220;I,&#8221; with a
period-point after it, thus&mdash;&#8220;I.&#8221; An inspection of the stamp itself
has impressed me with the belief, that the doubtful letter is truly
an &#8220;L;&#8221; and if so, the inscription would run:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
COLLYR. P. CLOC.
</p>

<p>Or, to read it in an extended form, <span class="smcap lowercase">COLLYR</span><i>ium</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span><i>ost</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span><i>a</i><span class="smcap lowercase">L</span><i>iginem</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase">OC</span><i>ulorum</i>&mdash;<i>Collyrium for blindness of the eyes</i>. And I may observe
that several of the prescriptions found on these medicine-stamps
are collyria professing to be useful against and after (<i>ad</i> and
<i>post</i>) <i>caliginem</i>.</p>

<p>But if the doubtful letter is an &#8220;I,&#8221; and not an L, then the inscrip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>tion,
when extended, may be read as follows:&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase">COLLYR</span><i>ium</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span><i>ost</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase">CI</span><i>catrices</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">OC</span><i>ulorum</i>, or, &#8220;<i>Collyrium after cicatrices of the eyes</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The P may stand for <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span><i>ro</i>, and not for <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span><i>ost</i>; but I am not aware
of any instance of the former preposition (<i>Pro</i>) occurring in these
inscriptions, while several examples of this use of the latter preposition
(<i>Post</i>) are known. An instance of this use of the preposition
<i>Post</i> will be found in the sequel, in Stamp No. VI.</p>

<h3>SECTION V.</h3>

<p class="center3">STAMP NO. IV.&mdash;FOUND AT COLCHESTER.</p>

<p>The first Roman medicine-stamp discovered in Great Britain was
described about a hundred and thirty years ago by Mr. Chishull
in the learned &#8220;Dissertatio De Nummo &#1017;&#922;&#969;&#928;&#921;,&#8221; which he addressed
to Haym, and which this last-mentioned author has published in
the preface to his second volume of the <i>Tesoro Brittanico</i>.</p>

<p>The stamp had been found some years previously at Colchester,
a well-known and extensive Roman colonial station. Mr. Chishull
believed it to have belonged to some old Roman Iatraliptes, or curer
by ointments.<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> The following is a copy of the inscription on this
Colchester stamp, as given by Chishull:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>And Mr. Chishull interpreted these inscriptions thus:&mdash;&#8220;Quinti
Julii Murranii Melinum, sive ex malis cotoneis oleum, ad claritatem
oculorum faciens. Iterumque, Quinti Julii Murranii stagium
opobalsamatum, sive myrrh&aelig; oleum opobalsamo permixtum, ad cap.
<i>i.e.</i>, ad caput medicandum utile.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this interpretation, Mr. Chishull seems to have fallen into
more than one important error, as we shall endeavour to show by
considering the two inscriptions in detail.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Q. JULII MURRANI MELINUM AD CLARITATEM.</span>&mdash;<i>The Melinum
of Q.</i> (<i>Quintus?</i>) <i>Julius Murranus, for clearness of vision.</i></p>

<p>Two or three varieties of the collyrium <i>Melinum</i> are given by
Galen.<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> Thus, in his list of collyria he gives formul&aelig; for the
<i>Melinum</i> of Lucius; for the <i>Melinum atarachum</i> (<i>i.e.</i> against the
taraxis); and for a <i>Melinum delicatum</i>, fitted for those who could
not bear the irritation of any powerful medicament.</p>

<p>Different opinions have been expressed in relation to the origin
and signification of the term <i>Melinum</i>. Walch,<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> like Chishull, derives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
the term from &#8220;malum&#8221; (&#956;&#8134;&#955;&#959;&#957;), an apple, supposing it to be
the principal ingredient in the collyrium. And certainly Pliny
and Paulus &AElig;gineta speak of an oil termed <i>melinum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> being made
from the quince (Malum Cydoneum); and the flower of the plant is
described by Pliny as useful in inflammation of the eyes. But no
&#8220;malum&#8221; enters into the composition of any of the three <i>Melina</i>
collyria, which I have referred to in Galen.</p>

<p>The best variety of alum seems, in ancient times, to have come
from the island of Melos; and, according to Pliny, this drug was
consequently termed <i>Melinum</i>. It was believed to be useful in
discussing granulations of the eyes (oculorum scabritias extenuat).<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a>
Hence Saxe (p. 29) and Tochon (p. 18) have conjectured that the
alum or <i>Melinum</i> of Pliny was the <i>Melinum</i> which has been found
inscribed on several oculist-stamps. But again, the same objection
holds,&mdash;namely, that in none of the collyria <i>Melina</i> of Galen was
alum a component ingredient.</p>

<p>In his observations, however, upon the different forms of emplastra
(and many of which were named <i>Melina</i>), Galen gives a sufficient
explanation of the origin of this term as it was applied to
plasters; and the same holds, no doubt, also in reference to its application
to collyria. According to his own explanation, it was a term
significant merely of the colour of the resulting medicament, like
the green, brown, etc., plasters and collyria, named <i>chloron</i>, <i>cirrhon</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>etc. etc. Gesner, Cooper, and other philologists, lay down <i>Melinum</i>
as an adjective, meaning yellow. And perhaps the term was originally
derived from the yellow colour of the quince or &#956;&#8134;&#955;&#959;&#957;, in the same
way as the <i>citrine</i> (<i>Unguentum Citrinum</i>), which is still common
in modern pharmaceutical language, was a term originally derived
from the yellow colour of the <i>citron</i> (&#954;&#953;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;) or lemon, and was applied
to designate ointments, etc., of that special tint. In further proof of
this origin and signification of the term <i>Melinum</i>, I may add, that, in
mixing together the ingredients contained in the <i>collyrium melinum
delicatum</i> of Galen (vol. xii. p. 769), I find that a yellow or orange-coloured
fluid is the result. The yellowish tint of the <i>emplastra
melina</i> was, as Galen tells us, generally, but not always, derived
from their containing verdigris, altered by a moderate boiling with
the other component ingredients.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> The collyria <i>Melina</i> of Galen
contain ceruse and calamine in their composition.</p>

<p>The <i>Melinum</i> is professed, in Murranus&#8217; stamp, to be efficacious
for the clearing of the eyesight (ad claritatem). The <i>Melina</i> collyria
of Galen are all alleged by him to have effects conducive to this
object&mdash;viz. the removing of cicatrices and calli, and every weakness
of vision (omnem hebetudinem visus).</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap lowercase">Q. JULII MURRANI STAGIUM (STACTUM) OPOBALSAMAT</span><i>um</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">AD</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
<span class="smcap lowercase">CAP</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">CAL</span><i>igines</i>).&mdash;<i>Q. Julius Murranus&#8217;s Opobalsamic Stactum, or
Opobalsamic Eye-drops, for dimness or blindness.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Chishull read <i>Stagium</i> instead of <i>Stactum</i>, the <span class="smcap lowercase">CT</span> of the
latter word having been mistaken by him for <span class="smcap lowercase">GI</span>. Mr. Forster
showed to the London Antiquarian Society,<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> in 1767, a plaster-cast
of what was doubtlessly this same Colchester stamp, and gave the
reading correctly in the second inscription as Stactum.</p>

<p>The Latin designation <i>Stactum</i>, analogous to the Greek terms
<i>Stacton</i>, <i>Enstacton</i>, and derived from the verb &#963;&#964;&#945;&#950;&#969; (I drop),
denoted any liquid collyrium, applied by drops into the eye&mdash;&#8220;collyria
enstacta, hoc est, instillatitia, appellata.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a></p>

<p>A collyrium, with the appellation <i>Stactum</i> or <i>Staticon</i>, is described
by Marcellus,<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> Myrepsus,<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> Paulus &AElig;gineta,<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> etc.; and Aetius<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> gives
a chapter of collyria under this designation. In this chapter Aetius
describes five collyria <i>Stactica</i>; and, of these, four contain the Opobalsam<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a>
as an ingredient, showing the origin and propriety of the
term <i>Opobalsamatum</i> in the inscription on the seal.</p>

<p class="tb">Chishull read the last three letters of the inscription <span class="smcap lowercase">CAP</span>, and
thought that the oil was serviceable for head diseases. But if the
inscription is not really <span class="smcap lowercase">CAL</span>, the <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span> has in all probability been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>substituted by an error of the engraver for <span class="smcap lowercase">L (CAL)</span>, an abbreviation
for Caligines. In confirmation of this opinion, I may remark
that the same inscription occurs at greater length on an oculist-stamp
found at Daspich in France; and in it the <i>Stactum Opobalsamatum</i>
is professed to remove <i>Caligines</i>.<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> There is, indeed, little
doubt but that Murranus of Colchester vended, of old, his Opobalsamic
Eye-drops for the same alleged purpose. This quality of
&#8220;visum acuens&#8221; is attributed to two out of the four forms of Opobalsamic
Eye-drops mentioned by Aetius. And the <i>Stactum</i> is
(according at least to the testimony of Myrepsus) &#8220;ad acumen
visus mirabile admodum.&#8221;&mdash;P. 660.</p>

<h3>SECTION VI.</h3>

<p class="center3">STAMP NO. V.&mdash;FOUND AT BATH.</p>

<p>This stamp was found, in the year 1731, at Bath, a well-known
Roman station. It was discovered in a cellar in the Abbey-yard.
Shortly afterwards the stamp was exhibited to the Antiquarian
Society of London by Mr. Cutler. Mr. Mitchell of Bristol, who
possessed the stone about the middle of the last century, submitted
it also for examination to the Royal Society of London. I have,
through Mr. Norman of Bath, and other friends in England, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>tempted
to trace out the present proprietor of the stamp, with a
view of ascertaining more correctly the exact nature of the inscriptions
upon it; but these efforts have been quite unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Mr. Lethieullier presented to the London Antiquarian Society
plaster casts of the inscriptions on the stamp; and three of these
plaster impressions of it are still preserved in the London Antiquarian
Museum. These plaster casts, however, are very imperfect; and
the lettering upon them is now unfortunately defective at some of
those very points that are otherwise the most difficult to decypher.</p>

<p>Manuscript notices of this Bath medicine-stamp exist in the
Minute-books of the Antiquarian Society for 1744 (vol. iv. p. 210),
and for 1757 (vol. viii. p. 29); the last is with an impression taken
with ink from the inscriptions. For copies of these I am deeply
indebted to the polite kindness of Mr. Akerman, the distinguished
secretary to the Society. The outline in Pl. II., No. V., presents
a copy of a rude drawing of the Bath stamp given in the Minute-book
of the Antiquarian Society for April 27, 1732.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> Mr. Akerman
has also obligingly furnished me with this sketch, which is
interesting as giving us the form of the stone. On the exposed
sides of this sketch there is given retrograde, as on the original
stone, one of the inscriptions. This inscription the engraver has
entered in the plate, as corrected from the pertaining plaster-cast
in the museum; and below it, in the plate, is a reversed impression
of this inscription.</p>

<p class="center">ROMAN MEDICINE STAMPS.</p></div>

<p>In 1788 Mr. Gough published, in the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, &#8220;Observations
on certain Stamps or Seals used anciently by the Oculists.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
this communication he has given, amongst others, copies of the
inscriptions on the medicine-stamp found at Bath; but without
making any attempt whatever to read and decypher these inscriptions.
He appears to have seen the stone itself, as he describes it
as &#8220;square, of a greenish cast, and perforated.&#8221; He presents the
following as the legends or inscriptions on the four sides of the
stamp:<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line i1">EC VMODELICTA AMEDICIS</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The two first of these inscriptions are given with sufficient distinctness
and accuracy; and they do not offer any great difficulties
in the way of explanation. But the two last have been copied so
imperfectly,&mdash;and, perhaps, so inaccurately,&mdash;by Mr. Gough, as to
surround their meaning with no small degree of uncertainty and
doubt.</p>

<p>In all of the four inscriptions, the name of the proprietor or
oculist, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>(<i>itus</i>?) <span class="smcap lowercase">JUNIANUS</span>, is perfectly distinct. The first side reads
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap lowercase">T. JUNIANI THALASSER AD CLARITATEM.</span> <i>T. Junianus&#8217; Thalasser
(or Marine Collyrium) for clearness of vision.</i></p>

<p>The collyrium <i>Thalasseros</i> (&#952;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;) is mentioned by several of
the old Greek and Roman authors, who have discussed the subject
of diseases of the eye and collyria, as by Galen,<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> Myrepsus,<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> Aetius,<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a>
Alexander Trallianus,<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> and Paulus &AElig;gineta.<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a></p>

<p>The name itself&mdash;<i>Thalasseros</i>&mdash;is evidently derived from &#952;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#951;,
the sea. Fuchs, the translator of Myrepsus, avows that he can form
no conjecture as to why the collyrium was termed Thalasseros (quam
autem ob causam nescio). In Cornarius&#8217; translation of Aetius, it is
entered as &#8220;Thalasserum, <i>hoc est marinum</i>.&#8221; And in all probability
it originally received its high-sounding and attractive appellation
from the marine colour of the preparation, the hue of the collyrium
being, as we have already seen, sometimes the cause and source of
its distinctive appellation, as in the collyria termed <i>Melinum</i>, <i>Cygnus</i>,
<i>Cirrhon</i>, etc. It has been conjectured that the name was imposed
upon it in consequence of one or other of its ingredients being of
marine origin. But in none of the formul&aelig; given for it by the
authors already named, does any sea ingredient enter into its
composition.<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a></p>

<p>The object of the <i>Thalasseros</i> in our inscription was to produce
clearness of vision (<i>ad claritatem</i>). It was used in vision impaired
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>from cataract (<i>suffusio</i>) and other causes. Galen describes the
<i>Thalasseros</i> of Hermophilus as &#8220;accomodatum ad suffusiones et ad
omnem hebetudinem visus; facit et ad incipientem suffusionem&#8221;
(vol. xii. p. 781). Myrepsus assigns to it the powers of &#8220;lachrymas
retinens, ad inchoantes suffusiones et nyctalopas, et ad recentem
pupill&aelig; dilatationem&#8221; (sect. xxiv. cap. 51). It is adapted, according
to Trallianus, &#8220;ad hebetudinem, et incipientes suffusiones; et
callos exterit&#8221; (lib. ii. cap. v. p. 175).</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap lowercase">T. JUNIANI C</span><i>e</i><span class="smcap lowercase">R</span><i>us</i><span class="smcap lowercase">SOMAELINUM AD CLARITATEM</span>.&mdash;<i>T. Junianus'
Leaden</i> (?) <i>Melinum (or Golden Yellow Collyrium) for clearness of
vision</i>.</p>

<p>I have already had occasion to speak of the signification and
qualities of the collyrium named <i>Melinum</i>. In the Colchester stamp
the <i>Melinum</i> is invested with the same supposed properties as the
<i>Crsomelinum</i> in the above legend on the Bath seal,&mdash;namely, &#8220;ad
claritatem.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a></p>

<p>The prefix <span class="smcap lowercase">CRSO</span>, in <i>Crsomelinum</i>, admits of more than one
interpretation. Galen gives four different formul&aelig; for &#8220;collyria
<i>Melina</i>.&#8221; Three of these contain, as one of their ingredients, the
<i>Cerussa</i>, or carbonate of lead; and the prefix <span class="smcap lowercase">CRSO</span> may possibly
stand as a contraction for <i>Cerussa</i>, implying the presence of this
medicine in the collyrium. And, in relation to this view, it is to be
recollected that this preparation of lead was, in these ancient times,
held in some esteem as a local application in eye-diseases. Galen
recommends it as an anodyne in pains of the eyes, and as a general
astringent and sedative application.<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>Another, and perhaps more probable meaning, has been suggested
to me by my friend M. Sichel. He supposes the <span class="smcap lowercase">CRSO</span> to be a contraction
for <span class="smcap lowercase">CHRSO</span>, <i>golden</i> (from &#967;&#961;&#965;&#963;&#959;&#962;, gold), the prefix marking the
golden colour of this <i>melinum</i>, or yellow collyrium. In this way
we would have Junianus retailing his &#8220;Golden Yellow Collyrium&#8221;
to the colonists and natives of Bath some sixteen centuries ago.
And we all know that &#8220;Golden Ointment&#8221; for the eyes is an application
not by any means unknown to the medical practitioners and
pharmacopolists of England in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap lowercase">T. JUNIANI DIEXUM AD VET</span><i>e</i><span class="smcap lowercase">RES CICATRICES.</span></p>

<p>In the above line I give the reading of the third side of the Bath
medicine-seal, such as it stands copied into the manuscript minute-books
of the Antiquarian Society for 17th November 1757. By turning
back to the inscription, as cited in a previous page from Gough, it
will be seen that the three medial letters <span class="smcap lowercase">IEX</span> are in a rude Brittano-Roman
character, which allows us only to guess at their true
signification. Unfortunately, the plaster cast of this side of the
stamp does not happen to be preserved with the others, so as to
enable us to ascertain the probability of either reading; and it is
more than doubtful whether the inscription thus given by these
opposed authorities is correctly copied, either by Gough, or in the
Society&#8217;s minute-book. And I believe I state the general experience
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>of all who have worked at the deciphering of Roman and other
inscriptions, in observing that the perplexities connected with the
reading of them have often been produced, much more by grave
errors in the published copies of the inscriptions, than by actual
difficulties in the interpretation of the original, after a true copy
has been once obtained.</p>

<p class="tb">In the present instance, by reversing the usual mode of procedure
in such investigations, we may perhaps arrive at the probable truth.
In other words, if we consider the disease prescribed for, we may
possibly arrive at a knowledge of the drug prescribed. Now the
affection on this side of the Bath stamp is <i>old cicatrices</i> (<span class="smcap lowercase">VETERES
CICATRICES</span>). This disease, or rather result of disease, is mentioned
on various Roman medicine-stamps discovered on the continent of
Europe, as on examples found at Verona, Lillebonne, Ingweiler, and
Saint Cheron,<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> and in one which I shall notice in the sequel, lately
detected in Ireland. In all the instances which I have just named,
the collyrium indicated on the inscriptions as the remedy <span class="smcap">(veteres
cicatrices</span>), is the collyrium termed <span class="smcap lowercase">DIAMYSOS</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">DIAMYSUM</span>, which
contained, as its principal ingredient, the metallic preparation
known under the name of &#924;&#953;&#963;&#965;, or Mysy, among the ancient medical
authors; and Marcellus Empiricus gives a formula for the formation
of a collyrium <span class="smcap lowercase">DIAMYSOS</span> from it. Looking to these facts, in relation
to other analogous Roman medicine-seals, it seems not an improbable
conjecture that the word on this third side of the Bath stamp
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>is the same, perhaps more or less mis-spelt or contracted; and
consequently, that the whole inscription is <span class="smcap lowercase">T. JUNIANI DIAMYSUM AD
VETERES CICATRICES</span>. The re-discovery of the stamp itself can alone
settle this and other difficulties connected with it.</p>

<p class="tb">If we judged of the nature of the inscription by the characters
of the letters, as given by Gough, the disputed word might perhaps
be more correctly read <span class="smcap lowercase">DRYCUM</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">DRYXUM</span>. And possibly, in this
way, it may signify an astringent and detergent collyrium, made
from the bark, acorn, or galls of the <span class="smcap lowercase">DRYS</span> (&#948;&#961;&#965;&#962;) or oak&mdash;a tree that
held a place in the materia medica of Hippocrates, Galen, and the
other ancients, and which still maintains its place in our own
modern Pharmacop&oelig;ias. Dioscorides, and the other old pharmaceutical
authorities, describe the <i>Drys</i> or Quercus as possessing
desiccant, astringent, and other properties; and they attribute
especially these powers to the gall excrescences that so often grow
upon it, and which they incorrectly deemed the fruit of this tree.
According to Oribasius, the gall of the oak&mdash;&#8220;siccat, repercutit,
contrahit, constringit, et particulas infirmas roborat.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a></p>

<p class="tb">Further, in favour of the present supposition, that the collyrium
of the inscription may possibly be named from the <span class="smcap lowercase">DRYS</span>, I may
take the present opportunity of mentioning that the ancient Roman
oculists seem to have pursued, in regard to old cicatrices of the eye,
a treatment which is not followed by their successors in modern
times. &#8220;All cicatrices on the transparent part of the eye,&#8221; says
Aetius, &#8220;appear white (omnes cicatrices in nigro oculi <i>alb&aelig;</i> appa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>rent&#8221;);<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a>
and consequently give, by their presence, a disagreeable
and disfiguring effect to the eye.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> Some of the Roman oculists seem
to have used various collyria, for the purpose of dyeing or changing
the colour of these white specks or pearly cicatrices, and of thus
imparting to them some kind of tint that rendered the appearance
of the eye, and the distinction between the transparent cornea and
its white opacities, less marked and striking. For this purpose the
gall-nuts of the oak or <span class="smcap lowercase">DRYS</span> appear to have been greatly used.
Aetius does not approve of the practice of tinting cicatrices; but,
in a chapter bearing the heading of &#8220;Albuginum Tinctur&aelig;,&#8221; he
describes half-a-dozen applications and collyria that might be
employed for the purpose of staining and correcting the colour of
old cicatrices of the eyes, lest, he adds, his readers should be ignorant
of the means which might effect this (ut ne ignorentur ea qu&aelig; hoc
facere possunt). In three or four of these collyria the gall-nut
forms a leading ingredient,<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> and it seems to have been generally
used previously to, or in combination with, blue vitriol (<i>atramentum
sutorium</i>). Myrepsus gives a &#8220;collyrium tingens crassas albugines
et cicatrices,&#8221; containing galls with chalcanthus (or copperas), roasted
lead, etc.; and a second formed of burnt and washed lead, etc.,
combined with unripe galls.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> Paulus &AElig;gineta mentions two dyes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>for cicatrices, both of them containing galls along with chalcanthus.<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a>
Alexander Trallianus gives a collyrium for staining cicatrices, which
he pronounces &#8220;valde generosum.&#8221; It consists principally of chalcanthus
and galls.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a></p>

<p>Lastly, let me offer one more conjecture. If the debateable word
in this legend be correctly copied as <span class="smcap lowercase">diexum</span> into the Antiquarian
Society minute-book, it may probably signify the collyrium <span class="smcap lowercase">DIOXUS</span>
or <span class="smcap lowercase">dioxum</span> given by Marcellus, and which he recommends for the
removal of granulations of the eyelids. This collyrium was composed
of cadmia, burnt copper, h&aelig;matites, myrrh, and gum.<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a></p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap lowercase">T. JUNIANI HOBSUM AD</span><i>&#961;</i><span class="smcap lowercase">UECUMO DELICTA A MEDICIS.</span></p>

<p>This fourth legend on the Bath stone offers the most puzzling of
all the inscriptions hitherto found upon the Roman medicine-stamps
discovered in Great Britain. As Mr. Gough gives it, the last words
of the inscription <span class="smcap lowercase">DELICTA</span>, or more probably <span class="smcap lowercase">DELECTA</span><a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a>&nbsp;<span class="smcap lowercase">A&nbsp;MEDICIS</span>
(esteemed by physicians), are alone intelligible. The plaster cast of
this side of the seal, contained in the Museum of the Antiquarian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>Society of London, contains an extremely imperfect copy of the
second line, and not an over perfect one of the first; but we see
enough in it to be quite aware of the great carelessness with which
Mr. Gough had originally copied the whole inscription. The
second last letter in the line is not the Greek &#961;, as Gough prints it,
but the Latin <span class="smcap lowercase">Q</span>; and the name of the collyrium is not <span class="smcap lowercase">HOBSUM</span>, as he
gives it, but apparently <span class="smcap lowercase">PHOEBUM</span>. At all events there is a <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span>, which
he has omitted, before the <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>; and the two medial letters, which he
read <span class="smcap lowercase">F S</span>, are seemingly <span class="smcap lowercase">E B</span>. Such is the conclusion to which a
careful examination of the lettering of the cast itself forces me; and
what is much more important,&mdash;because affording far stronger
evidence than mine,&mdash;Mr. Akerman reads this inscription in the
same way. I may add, that (as I am informed by the same
gentleman) the word is always copied and written as <span class="smcap lowercase">PHOEBUM</span>, in
the several notices of the stamp contained in the minute-books of
the Antiquarian Society, and to which I have already referred; and
Gough&#8217;s Greek &#961; is always given as the Roman <span class="smcap">Q</span>.</p>

<p>Still, with all these emendations, I confess myself quite at a
loss to decipher, satisfactorily, the inscription. The spelling of all
the inscriptions on this stamp is executed very carelessly,&mdash;as in
<i>crsomaelinum</i> for <i>crysomelinum</i>; <i>thalaser</i> for <i>thalasser</i>; and possibly
the term <span class="smcap lowercase">QUECVMO</span> may be a mis-spelling by the engraver for
<span class="smcap lowercase">LEUCOMA</span>. If so, the inscription would stand as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">T JUNIANI PHOEBUM AD LU</div>
<div class="line">ECOMA DELECTA A MEDICIS.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Or, as we may then translate it, &#8220;<i>The Phoebum of T. Junianus for
Leucoma, esteemed by physicians</i>.&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<p>I am not aware that any of the old authors have described a collyrium
under the name of <span class="smcap lowercase">PHOEBUM</span>. But it looks like one of those
specious titles which the oculists were so fond of selecting and
assuming; and we find described in their works collyria with
analogous semi-astronomical and mythological appellations, such as
<i>Sol</i>, <i>Aster</i>, <i>Lumen</i>, <i>Phos</i>, <i>Uranium</i>, etc.<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a></p>

<p class="tb">I shall venture only one more remark, viz. the possibility of the
term being <span class="smcap lowercase">PHORBIUM</span> and not <span class="smcap lowercase">PHOEBUM</span>. &#8220;The <span class="smcap lowercase">PHORBIUM</span>,&#8221; observes
Galen, &#8220;possesses attenuating, attractive, and discutient powers.
They apply its seeds, mixed with honey, to <span class="smcap lowercase">LEUCOMA</span>; and it is
believed to have the power of extracting spicula of wood.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a></p>

<h3>SECTION VII.</h3>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap lowercase">STAMP NO. VI.&mdash;FIRST DESCRIBED BY MR. DOUCE.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Douce published in 1778<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> a notice of a square flattened
Roman medicine-stamp, a quarter of an inch thick, and each side
or edge measuring about two inches.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p><p>Mr. Gough published in the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i> a sketch of this
stamp, which is copied into Pl. II., No. VI. Some wax impressions
were taken of the stone, but the stone itself was (it is stated in
the same volume of the <i>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</i>, 1778, p. 510) &#8220;lost
out of a pocket that had a hole in it, and probably, instead of
gracing a museum, has contributed its mite towards mending the
roads.&#8221;</p>

<p>The four sides of the stone contained the following series of
inscriptions, the terminal and initial letters of three of the lines
being wanting, and supplied in our copy below by italic letters:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="line">4. (<i>m</i>)JULSATYRIPENI</div>
<div class="line i1">CILLENEEXOVO</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The name of the oculist, <span class="smcap lowercase">M. JUL. SATYRUS</span>&mdash;<i>M(arcus?) Jul(ius)
Satyrus</i>&mdash;is sufficiently distinct, and occurs with each of the four
legends of the stamp. When we analyse further the inscriptions
on the four sides of the seal, they severally read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>(<i>arci</i>) <span class="smcap lowercase">JUL</span><i>ii</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">SATYRI DIALEPIDOS AD ASP</span><i>e</i><span class="smcap lowercase">R</span><i>itudines</i>.&mdash;<i>Marcus
Julius Satyrus&#8217; Dialepidos or Copper collyrium for granulations of
the eyelids.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<p>The three first sides of this stamp have the special collyria
inscribed upon them, beginning each with the letters <span class="smcap lowercase">DIA</span>, from the
Greek preposition &#948;&#953;&#945;, &#8220;with,&#8221; and here signifying &#8220;made with.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a>
The three principal ingredients in the three first inscriptions are
all given, combined with this initial preposition &#948;&#953;&#945;, and under their
Greek appellatives,&mdash;&#955;&#949;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#959;&#962;, &#963;&#956;&#965;&#961;&#957;&#945; and &#955;&#953;&#946;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;&mdash;forming instances,
among many others, of the anxiety of the ancient Roman oculists
to invest their drugs with all the mysterious attraction and formality
of a Greek name; just as some modern English physicians foolishly
enough consider it still proper to write always the names of the medicines
which they now prescribe in the language of the ancient Romans,
thus, like their predecessors, attempting, in the exercise of
their profession, to act upon that principle in the weakness of human
nature which holds &#8220;omne ignotum pro mirifico.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have already described (see Stamp No. II., p. <a href="#Page_245">245</a>) the composition
of the collyrium termed <i>Dialepidos</i>, and the origin of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>name of the inscription from the &#955;&#949;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#962;, or scales of the oxide of
copper.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap lowercase">M. JUL. SATYRI DIASMI</span><i>rn</i><span class="smcap lowercase">ES POST IMPETUM LIPPIT</span><i>udinis</i>.&mdash;<i>The
Diasmyrnes or Myrrh collyrium of M. Jul. Satyrus, after the commencement
of ophthalmy.</i></p>

<p>The principal ingredients in the collyrium <i>Diasmyrnes</i>, namely,
myrrh (&#956;&#8164;&#8165;&#965;&#945; or &#963;&#956;&#965;&#961;&#957;&#945;), was a drug to which important therapeutical
virtues were formerly ascribed. It was applied in the
treatment of various diseases. In reference to affections of the
eye, it had the power, according to Dioscorides, of filling up
ulcers of the organ, removing cicatrices and scales obstructing
the pupil; and besides, it cured eruptions and granulations of
the eyelids (oculorum ulcera complet, exteritque albugines, et ea
quae pupillis tenebras offundunt; quin et scabritias seu asperitudines
expolit).<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a></p>

<p>Various collyria were used by the ancients, bearing the name of
<i>Diasmyrnes</i> or <i>Diasmyrnon</i>, from myrrh constituting their leading
ingredient. Aetius has one of his long chapters on collyria headed
&#8220;Collyria Diasmyrna et Chiaca appellata.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> Actuarius, in his section
&#8220;De affectionibus Oculorum,&#8221; speaks of the collyria <i>Diasmyrna</i> (qu&aelig;
ex myrrha constant) in the plural number, and as well known in his
time.<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> Paulus &AElig;gineta, in discussing the treatment of hypopion or
suppuration in the cornea, speaks of sometimes making the abscess
burst; and, if so, then, he adds, &#8220;cleanse the ulcer by means of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>more potent remedies, such as those called <i>Diasmyrna</i>,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> etc. Among
his formul&aelig; for individual collyria in his several books, he gives a
receipt for the collyria <i>Diasmyrnes</i>. (Aldine edition, p. 118.)</p>

<p>Galen gives several collyria <i>Diasmyrna</i>, as the <i>Diasmyrnum</i> Odorum
Synerotis,<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> the <i>Diasmyrnum</i> Glaucidanum, and the <i>Diasmyrnum</i>
ex h&aelig;matite.<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> And in his work <i>De Simplicium Medicamentorum
Temperamentis ac Facultatibus</i>, he states, &#8220;Sed et collyria
sunt plurima qu&aelig; medeantur suffusionibus, et maxime quod plurimam
recipit myrrham, quale est quod a Democrate compositum est,
quod vocant <i>Diasmyrnon</i>.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a></p>

<p>The term <i>Lippitudo</i> in this legend, and which we will find recurring
in the sequel, was, according to Galen, anciently applied to
that form of ophthalmy which consists of inflammation of the conjunctival
covering of the cornea (lippitudo inflammatio est membran&aelig;,
qu&aelig; corne&aelig; adnata est.)<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> But the term was also used to
designate other forms or varieties of ophthalmic inflammation. The
disease described by Celsus under the name of <i>Lippitudo</i> appears
(says a high modern authority on eye-diseases) to have been &#8220;catarrhal
conjunctivitis.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> The same oculist speaks of Lippitudo
as &#8220;an excoriation of the edges of the lids, or bleared eyes;&#8221; and
he describes obliteration of the Meibomian follicles as the cause of
incurable Lippitudo.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap lowercase">M. JULII. SATYRI DIALIBANU</span><i>m</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">AD SUPPURAT</span><i>ionem</i>.&mdash;<i>M. Jul.</i>

<p>Frankincense (<i>thus</i>, &#955;&#953;&#946;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;, &#955;&#953;&#946;&#945;&#957;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#962;)<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> was frequently used by
the ancient oculists in their collyria. According to Galen<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a> and Paulus
&AElig;gineta,<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> in consequence of its detergent powers, it apparently
cleanses and fills up ulcers in the eyes (expurgare et implere qu&aelig;
in oculis consistunt ulcera videtur). It has the power, according to
Oribasius, &#8220;astringendi, calefaciendi, <i>caliginem oculorum</i> discutiendi,
cava ulcera implendi, ad cicatricem perducendi,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> etc.</p>

<p>Alexander Trallianus gives a formula for the collyrium <i>Dialibanum
ad chemosim efficax</i>; and he describes the <i>Dialibanum</i> as,
like the Libanum, of much use in eye-diseases, and particularly
for inflammations which are accompanied with ulceration (multi
est usus, maxime ad inflammationes quae cum ulcere infestant).<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a>
Celsus recommends it in ulcers of the eye following pustules (fit
quoque proprie ad h&aelig;c quod &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#955;&#953;&#946;&#8049;&#957;&#959;&#965; vocatur).<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> Paulus &AElig;gineta
gives a formula for the <i>Dialibanum</i>, in his chapter on collyria.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a>
Marcellus Empiricus, who offers two recipes for its composition,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>ascribes to it the power of being efficacious in the disease noted on
our inscription, namely, &#8220;ad suppurationes oculorum.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a></p>

<p>When speaking of the treatment of suppuration of the eye,
Galen lays down the following indications for the use of the <i>Diasmyrnes</i>,
and <i>Dialibanum</i>:&mdash;&#8220;At quando pus, quod in oculis est,
digerere placet, collyriis qu&aelig; myrrham habent, maxime utemur;
qu&aelig; utique et <i>Diasmyrna</i> Gr&aelig;ci proprie vocant; his certe minus,
sed reliquis melius faciunt qu&aelig; <i>Dialibanum</i> vocant.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a></p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">(m): jul: satyri penic</span><i>illum</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">LENE EX OVO</span>.&mdash;<i>M. Jul. Satyrus'
mild Penicillum; to be used with an egg.</i></p>

<p>The term <i>Penicillum</i> has been found inscribed on several different
Roman medical stamps, as upon specimens discovered at Vieux
and Paris, each marked with <i>lene penicillum</i>; upon one discovered
at Nais (<i>penicillum ad omnem lippitudinem</i>); and upon another
at Famars. Its signification has given rise to several opinions
somewhat differing from each other.</p>

<p>M. Grivaud considers the <i>Penicillum</i> indicated on the Roman
medicine-stamps, to be merely a small brush or hair-pencil, such
as is still used at the present day to wipe away the more viscid
discharges that may be found adhering to the palpebr&aelig; and eyelashes.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a>
According to M. Sichel, the <i>Penicillum</i> consisted of a
pledget or folds of charpie, which the ancient oculists used both
for the purpose of cleansing the eyes, and of introducing into them
soothing washes and collyria.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a> M. Eloi Johanneau,<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a> and M.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>Duchalais,<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a> describe the <i>Penicillum</i> as a soft and fine sponge,
employed in applying collyria to the diseased eye. Blancardi, in
his <i>Lexicon Medicum</i>, defines the word <i>Penicillum</i> as &#8220;lint reduced
to charpie, and besmeared with ointment to be applied to
ulcers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The word <i>Penicillum</i> occurs in the writings of Pliny and Celsus,
and is used by these ancient authorities in such a manner as to
give countenance to each of the preceding opinions. Thus Pliny,
in his chapter on sponges (<i>De Spongiarum Natura</i>), speaks of a
variety of very fine sponge under the name of <i>Penicillum</i>; and
this, when soaked in a preparation of honeyed wine (mulso), was,
he says, applied to tumours of the eyes.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> These <i>Penicilli</i> were
also (he adds) useful, when very soft and fine, in cleansing the eye
in ophthalmy.<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> Celsus, in his observations on the diseases of the
eye, three or four times, and in different senses, uses the term.
In inflammation of the eye, he recommends the eyes to be fomented
with a <i>Penicillum</i> or pledget, squeezed out of a warm watery decoction
of myrtle or rose leaves, before local medicines and collyria
are applied to them.<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> Elsewhere, he recommends a pledget or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span><i>Penicillum</i> to be laid, or, if necessary, bound over the eyes, squeezed
out of water; or, if the attack is more severe, out of vinegar and
water (<i>Penicillo</i> uti expresso ex aqua; si major, ex posca).<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> In
another passage, he states that in intense ophthalmia the white of
an egg or the milk of woman, dropped into the eye with a <i>Penicillum</i>,
relieves the inflammation, and that this may be used by
the patient when neither a physician nor other medicines are at
hand.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> And again, he recommends the patient to take a bath, and
foment his head and eyes freely with the warm water, then to
wipe both with a <i>Penicillum</i>, and anoint his head with iris ointment.<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a>
Here we have the <i>Penicillum</i> used by the same author as
a mechanical means both of cleansing the eye and of making local
applications to it. Further, in his chapter on the surgery of the
eyes, Celsus uses the word <i>Penicillum</i> in the signification of tents.
Thus, in describing the operation for ancyloblepharon, or agglutination
of the eyelids, he directs the eyelids, after being separated
by a probe, to be kept asunder by small <i>penicilla</i> laid between
them, till the ulceration of the part is cured.<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span></p><p>The preceding quotations show that, besides other significations,
there is no doubt that the term <i>Penicillum</i> was used to designate
a soft sponge, and perhaps also a brush or pledget of charpie that
was occasionally employed in ophthalmic practice, for the double
purpose of fomenting or cleansing the eye, and of dropping local
applications into it. But it seems very unlikely that a stamp
should be used by the oculist to mark the material of these <i>Penicilli</i>
with. It would be both difficult and unnecessary to stamp in
any way either a piece of sponge or of charpie with such an
inscription as that found upon this and the other Roman seals.
And I would venture to suggest, that it appears much more probable
that the collyrium, ointment, or lotion, that was to be used
with the sponge or charpie, was sometimes designated <i>Penicillum</i>,
from the special mode in which it was to be applied; in the same
way as we have found various eye-drops passing under the general
designation of <i>Stactum</i>, from the special mode in which they were
applied to the diseased organ. In this way the <span class="smcap lowercase">LENE PENICILLUM</span> in
the legend of our present oculist-stamp would not signify the
material which was used in the application of the medicine, but
the name of the medicine or collyrium as indicative of the mode
in which it was to be used.</p>

<p>The employment of the collyrium <span class="smcap lowercase">PENICILLUM</span> mixed with an
egg (<span class="smcap lowercase">EX OVO</span>) is often indicated upon the oculist-stamps; and in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>the ancient Roman authors it is a mode in which many of the
collyria were directed to be prepared before they were applied to
the diseased eye.</p>

<h3>SECTION VIII.</h3>

<p class="center3">STAMP NO. VII.&mdash;CONTAINED IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM.</p>

<p>In his paper in the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i> (vol. ix.), Mr. Gough published
a sketch and account of a medicine-stamp, inscribed on three of its
sides, and remarkable in one or two respects. The sketch which he
has given of it is copied into Plate II., No. VII. The stamp itself
is preserved in the British Museum. It is thicker, and more
rounded at the edges, than the generality of these flat medicine-stones.</p>

<p>After quoting the three inscriptions on its sides, Mr. Gough
gives the following very brief and unsatisfactory account of the
reading of this stamp. &#8220;From the inscriptions,&#8221; he observes, &#8220;we

that his composition was made of Opobalsamum and Myrrh, and
the white of eggs.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a></p>

<p>Mr. Gough pointed out that the third side of the stamp was
engraved in letters of a rude and negligent form, and different
in character from the inscriptions on the two other sides. But he
failed in seeing that the remaining sides are both imperfect; and
that the latter half of one of the inscriptions, and the first half of
the other, are deficient, in consequence of the stone, which was at
first much larger, having been broken or reduced in size, and sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>sequently
again rubbed down and smoothed on two of its sides
before one of these sides was cut with the rude lettering above
alluded to. When these circumstances are attended to, the inscriptions
on the three sides appear to stand as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The name of the proprietor is evidently <span class="smcap lowercase">L. JUL. IVENIS</span> [L(<i>ucius</i>?)
<i>Jul</i>(<i>ius</i>) <i>Ivenis</i>]; and I may remark in passing, that the cognomen
of <span class="smcap lowercase">IVENIS</span> is one which has been found recurring among the Roman
pottery-stamps found in England.</p>

<p>It is impossible to fill in, with anything like precision and
certainty, the defective words in the two first inscriptions. But
judging from the analogy of other similar and more perfect stamps,
these two inscriptions probably read somewhat as follows when the
seal was entire.</p>

<p class="tb">1. <span class="smcap lowercase">L. JUL. IVENIS</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span><i>iapsoricum</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">OPOBALSAM</span><i>a</i><span class="smcap lowercase">TU</span><i>m</i> <i>ad Claritatem</i>.&mdash;<i>L.
Jul. Ivenis&#8217; Opobalsamic Diapsoricum</i> <i>for clearing of the sight</i>.</p>

<p>The adjective, <span class="smcap lowercase">OPOBALSAMATUM</span>, has hitherto been generally
found united upon medicine-stamps with one of two collyria&mdash;viz.
with <i>Stacticum</i> (as in seal No. IV.); or with <i>Diapsoricum</i>, as in
seals found at Jena and Lyons. The D preserved in the first line
is, in all probability, the initial letter of the latter collyrium.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Psoricum</i> was a mixture of cadmia and chalcitis, according
to Dioscorides, Pliny, and Celsus;<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a> or of litharge and chalcitis,
according to Galen, Aetius, and Paulus &AElig;gineta.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> This metallic
compound derived its name of <i>Psoricum</i> from its supposed utility
in the treatment of parts affected with the eruption of scabies or
<i>psora</i>. The eyelids, according to the ancient oculists, were the
occasional seat of eruptive or pruriginous inflammation (<i>psorophthalmia</i>,
<i>scabrities</i>, <i>prurigo</i>, etc.) In enumerating the diseases of the
lining membrane of the palpebr&aelig;, Galen mentions, among others,
<i>sycosis</i>, <i>chalazosis</i>, and <i>psoriasis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a> Various collyria employed for the
removal of these affections were termed <i>Psorica</i>, and most of them,
though not all, contained the metallic compound alluded to. &#8220;Quae
scabros in palpebris affectus persanant, atque ob id <i>Psorica</i> appellantur.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a>
When speaking of the specific affections of the eyes
and their appropriate local applications, Actuarius, in the same
way, remarks, &#8220;Quae scabiosis palpebrarum affectionibus medentur,
id circo <i>Psorica</i> appellantur.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> He gives (p. 307) formul&aelig; for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>various forms of the <i>Collyrium Psoricum</i>; as the <i>Psoricum aridum</i>,
the <i>Psoricum Aelii</i>, etc. Aetius recommends the collyrium <i>Psoricum</i>
against &#8220;scabros ac corrosos angulos, et intensos pruritus,
milphoses et prurigines.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a> Scribonius Largus describes the composition
of a collyrium <i>Psoricum</i> made from the metallic compound
of the same name (facit hoc collyrium bene quod <i>psoricum</i> dicitur),
and fitted to remove blindness, granulations, and xero-ophthalmia.<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a>
Marcellus Empiricus credulously invests the collyrium <i>Psoricum</i>
with signal powers for various eye-diseases, but particularly for old-standing
blindness (antiquam coecitatem). For if (says he) we may
credit the experience of the author of the remedy, it has, at the end
of twenty days, restored sight to a person who had been blind for
twelve years (nam ut auctori hujus remedii de experimento credamus,
duodecim annorum coeco intra dies viginti visum restituisse se
dicit).<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a></p>

<p>On the Jena medicine-stamp the <i>Diapsoricum Opobalsamatum</i> is
entered as efficacious for the clearing of the sight (ad claritatem);<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a>
and in the proposed restoration of the reading of the present English
stamp, I have added to it the same therapeutic indication, as one
not unlikely to have originally filled up the part that is now deficient
in this line of the stamp.</p>

<p>2. <i>L. Jul. Ivenis</i> <i>Di</i><span class="smcap lowercase">ASMYRNES</span> <span class="smcap lowercase">BIS</span> <i>Lippitudinis</i> <i>i</i><span class="smcap lowercase">MPETU EX OVO</span>.&mdash;<i>The
myrrh collyrium of L. J. Ivenis, to be used twice a day, mixed
with an egg, at the commencement of Ophthalmy</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p><p>Already we have considered the composition, etc., of the Collyrium
<i>Diasmyrnes</i> (see pp. 267, 268.) It is entered, as efficacious
in attacks of Lippitudo, on the medicine-stamps of Jena, Nais,
etc. In the Jena stamp it is, as in the present instance, ordered
to be used mixed with an egg.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a></p>

<p>The word <span class="smcap lowercase">BIS</span> denotes, in all probability, the frequency with
which it was to be used daily. Occasionally the ancient authors
state in the same way in their works the frequency with which a
special collyrium was to be used. Thus, for example, Paulus
&AElig;gineta, after describing the composition of the brown collyrium
(collyrium fuscum), adds that it is to be applied thrice a day (illinitur
<i>ter</i> in die ... ex ovo aut lacte, etc.)<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a> Indeed when
speaking of the variety of collyrium mentioned in the legend on
this stamp,&mdash;namely, of the &#8220;collyria qu&aelig; quod ex myrrha constant
&#948;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#965;&#961;&#957;&#945; vocantur,&#8221; Actuarius expressly states that the affected
eye is to be annointed with the <i>Diasmyrnes</i> &#8220;twice a day (<i>bis</i> in
die).&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a></p>

<p>3. The third side of this medicine-stamp is engraved, as already
observed, by a different and far more inexperienced hand than the
other two sides. The letters are very roughly and rudely formed.
The inscription indicates the name of another oculist,&mdash;of one who
probably became the possessor of the stamp after <span class="smcap lowercase">IVENIS</span>. The new
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>proprietor&#8217;s name is <span class="smcap">F</span>., or probably <span class="smcap lowercase">FL., SECUNDUS</span>, and the inscription
reads, <span class="smcap lowercase">F. SEKUNDI AT ALBAS</span>, <i>the collyrium</i> or <i>preparation</i> of <i>F.
Secundus against Albugines</i>.</p>

<p>In reading it, I suppose the <span class="smcap lowercase">AT</span> to be a mis-spelling for <span class="smcap lowercase">AD</span>,&mdash;a
mistake of which there are not wanting other examples in the
illiterate and careless engravings sometimes found upon these
medicine-stamps.<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> And I have interpreted the <span class="smcap lowercase">ALBAS</span> as signifying
<i>albas cicatrices</i> (white cicatrices), or, in other words, <i>albugines</i>
of the cornea,&mdash;a suggestion for which I am indebted to M. Sichel.
Already I have quoted the expression of Aetius to the effect that
all cicatrices of the cornea are &#8220;<i>Alb&aelig;</i>;&#8221; and the nouns by which
such eye-cicatrices are designated, both by the Greek and Roman
physicians, namely, &#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#969;&#956;&#945; and <i>albugo</i>, are words derived from,
and intended to signify, the white colour (&#955;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#959;&#962;, <i>albus</i>) of these
lesions.</p>

<h3>SECTION IX.</h3>

<p class="center3">STAMP NO. VIII.&mdash;FOUND AT SOUTHWELL.</p>

<p>An anonymous correspondent, C. D., sent to the <i>Gentleman&#8217;s
Magazine</i>, in 1772, a sketch and notice of what, no doubt, is a
Roman medicine-stamp, but both the sketch given of it and the
description are excessively meagre. The correspondent dates his
letter from Southwell, in Nottinghamshire. He says, &#8220;The inscribed
stone was found lately by casting up the ground, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>neighbourhood of Littleborough in this county. The stone is oblong,
about two inches long, and one broad. It contains inscriptions
on the edges or rim of the two ends, and on one of its oblong
sides, but not on the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; says the correspondent, &#8220;supposed to be a Tessera or
kind of tally, such being, as we are told, a little flat square piece of
stone, and having a particular inscription, and was used in the
Roman armies, by being on certain occasions delivered to each of
the soldiers, to distinguish them from the enemy, and also in
setting their nightly guard, by being given from one centurion to
another, quite through the army, till it returned to the tribune who
first delivered it. Upon the receipt of this, the guard was set immediately.
But,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;as the inscription on the above
drawing cannot be made out to satisfaction, many of you will be
glad to know whether it has been such a Tessera as is above supposed;
or what else it may have been, or also an explanation of
its legend, by some of your antiquarian correspondents.&#8221;</p>

<p>The inscription on one of the long sides of the stone appears
to be the name of the proprietor of the stamp; but the published
copy of it presents such irregular lettering, as to defy any certain
deciphering of what the name is. (See Plate III., No. VIII.) On
the other two sides the inscriptions are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">1. B. DIASORICV.</div>
<div class="line">2. STATVS.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>These two words evidently are mis-spellings, either on the
original stamp, or (what is equally probable) in its published copy,
for the Collyria termed <i>Diapsoricum</i> and <i>Stactum</i>. But I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>already, in reference to previous inscriptions, discussed the signification
of these two terms at such length as not to require to revert
to them. (See under Stamps No. IV. and No. VIII.)</p>

<p>The initial B, as it stands in the first line, seems to defy all
kinds of conjecture in regard to its signification. In this, as in
one or two other instances, the only hope of obtaining a true
reading of the legend is in the re-discovery of the stamp itself.</p>

<h3>SECTION X.</h3>

<p class="center3">STAMP NO. IX.&mdash;FOUND AT WROXETER.</p>

<p>This seal is remarkable both from its inscription, and from its
round form. In this last respect it is, I believe, as yet unique,&mdash;no
other specimen of a medicine-stamp of the same circular figure
having, as far as I know, been hitherto described. The stone is
about seven-eighths of an inch in diameter, and a quarter of an
inch thick. Its form and inscription are seen in Plate III. No. IX.,
where the upper figure shows the stamp presenting the usual incuse
and reversed inscription; and the second or lower figure shows the
impression left by the stamp upon wax.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a></p>

<p class="center">ROMAN MEDICINE STAMPS.</p></div>

<p>This curious medicine-stamp was found, in 1808, by a person
ploughing in a field near the Roman wall at Wroxeter (the ancient
Uriconium), Shropshire. It was first figured and very briefly
noticed by Mr. Parkes in the <i>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</i> for 1810, p. 617.
&#8220;Several (observes Mr. Parkes) have attempted to decipher the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>legend, but no one has as yet been able to give a satisfactory reading.&#8221;
Mr. Nightingale (1813), in his account of Shropshire in the
<i>Beauties of England and Wales</i><a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a> mentions the stamp; and Mr.
Hartshorne in his <i>Salopia Antiqua</i><a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> (1841), has given an embellished
and consequently less accurate copy of the inscription than
that originally published by Mr. Parkes. Mr. Hartshorne describes
it as &#8220;an amuletal seal,&#8221; and adds, &#8220;it has hitherto baffled the
endeavours of those who have attempted to explain it.&#8221; Lastly,
Mr. Albert Way has lately correctly published it as a specimen of
a Roman medicine-stamp, and has interpreted the second and fifth
lines, leaving the others still undetermined. But the whole appears
capable of being deciphered. The inscription runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center2">IBCLM</p>
<p class="center2">DIA LBA</p>
<p class="center2">AD OM</p>
<p class="center2">NE &#916; VN</p>
<p class="center2">O EX O</p>

<p><span class="smcap lowercase">J</span> (<i>ulii?</i>) <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> (<i>assi?</i>) <span class="smcap lowercase">CL</span><i>e</i><span class="smcap lowercase">M</span><i>entis</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">DIAL</span><i>i</i><span class="smcap lowercase">BA</span><i>num</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">AD OMNEM</span> &#916;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#957;
(Diathesin) <span class="smcap lowercase">VNO EX O</span><i>vo</i>.&mdash;<i>The Dialibanum or Incense collyrium of
Julius Bassus Clemens, for every eye-disease; to be used mixed with
an egg.</i></p>

<p>The name of the practitioner or proprietor, given in the first line
of the seal, offers the principal difficulty in reading the inscription.
But the <span class="smcap lowercase">CLM</span> is in all probability a contraction, as I have ventured
to interpret it, for <span class="smcap lowercase">CLEMENS</span>,&mdash;a common cognomen or family name
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>among the Romans. The B as an initial could stand for any of
the various gens names which begin with this letter, as Balbus,
Betutius, etc. I have conjecturally given it as <i>Bassus</i>, principally
because on an old monumental tablet, discovered at Leyden,<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a> the
cognomen of <span class="smcap lowercase">CLEMENS</span> is preceded by the nomen gentilicium of
<span class="smcap lowercase">BASSUS</span>,&mdash;showing the combination in question not to have been
unknown among the Roman colonists formerly scattered over
Western Europe. Besides, <i>Bassus</i> was a name by no means unknown
in ancient Roman medical literature and practice. When
mentioning, in the preface to his first Book, the more distinguished
disciples and followers of Asclepiades, Dioscorides places, as the
foremost in his enumeration, <i>Julius Bassus</i>. Galen (<i>De Simpl.
Medicam. Facult.</i> lib. i. cap. 7) and C&aelig;lius Aurelianus (<i>Contra
Hereses</i>&mdash;Preface to lib. i.) both cite the practice and authority of
<i>Bassus</i>; and Pliny, in his <i>Index Auctorum</i>, mentions that this
physician wrote in Greek, although he was by birth a Roman.<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a></p>

<p>The nature and composition of the Collyrium <i>Dialibanum</i> we
have already had occasion to consider under a former head. (See
Stamp No. VI., p. <a href="#Page_253">253.</a>)</p>

<p>I have also formerly shown that the Greek term &#916;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; was
used as a general term for eye-disease (see p. <a href="#Page_241">241</a>); and no doubt
its initial letter &#916; stands in the present inscription under this
signification.</p>

<p>Many of the ancient collyria were, like the <i>Dialibanum</i>, preserved
and sold in a firm or solid form, and were directed to be dissolved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>or mixed with the white of one or more eggs at the time when they
were required for application to the eye.<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a> Hence the expression,
<span class="smcap lowercase">UNO &#8220;EX OVO,&#8221;</span> in this and other stamp legends.</p>

<p>This stamp, like some others, has a rude figure of a plant engraved
along with the inscription. The trunk of the plant is given
at the commencement of the third line by Mr. Hartshorne as an I&mdash;thus
unnecessarily confusing the reading of the legend.</p>

<h3>SECTION XI.</h3>

<p class="center3">STAMP NO. X.&mdash;FOUND AT KENCHESTER.</p>

<p>In the Journal of the British Arch&aelig;ological Association for
1849, Mr. Roach Smith has described a medicine-stamp found at
Kenchester, in Herefordshire, and communicated to him by Mr.
Johnson. I myself am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Johnson
for both a model and drawings of this medicine-stamp, which is
quadrilateral, and engraved on its four sides. It has, besides, the
word SENIOR inscribed on one of its flat surfaces; and the four first
letters of the same word are repeated on the opposite surface. I
shall afterwards have occasion to re-advert to this curious point.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith has published a sketch of the stamp; but the more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>correct drawings of it in Plate III., No. X., have been kindly furnished
to me by Mr. Johnson. The six lowest figures in this
plate represent, first, the two flat surfaces of the stone, with the
retrograde inscriptions upon its four sides; and, secondly, these
four inscriptions as they appear when impressed upon wax.</p>

<p>The inscriptions on the four sides of this stamp read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">1. F.VINDAC.ARIO</div>
<div class="line i1">VISTIANICET</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">2. T.VINDACIAR</div>
<div class="line i1">(<i>i</i>)OVISTINARD</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">3. (T) VINDAC. ARI</div>
<div class="line i1">OVISTI CHLORON</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">4. T. VINDAC . ARIO</div>
<div class="line i1">VISTI ... RINM</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The name of the oculist or proprietor,<span class="smcap"> t. vindac ariovistus</span>,
<i>Titus (?) Vindacius</i> or <i>Vindex Ariovistus</i>, is singular; the name
<span class="smcap lowercase">ARIOVISTUS</span> being the same as that of the celebrated German king
and general that plays so interesting and important a part in the
Commentaries of C&aelig;sar, and the reputed valour and prowess of
whose troops daunted for a time, and almost created a mutiny in,
C&aelig;sar&#8217;s army.</p>

<p>On this stamp there are no names of any specific eye-diseases
given; but the four sides contain the designation of four collyria
that we have not met with on any of the previous medicine-stamps
which we have had occasion to describe. These are the collyria
<i>Anicetum</i>, <i>Nardinum</i>, <i>Chloron</i>, and <i>Thurinum</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap lowercase">T. VINDAC</span><i>ii</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">ARIOVISTI ANICETUM</span>.&mdash;<i>The Anicetum</i> or <i>infallible
Collyrium of T. Vindacius Ariovistus</i>.</p>

<p>The collyrium <i>Anicetum</i>, or &#913;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#957;, is, as far as I know,
described by Oribasius alone. It was composed of red copper,
combined with henbane, hemlock, spikenard, frankincense, etc.
Oribasius enters it as a collyrium &#8220;ad carbunculos aptum.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a></p>

<p>Mr. Roach Smith supposes that the collyrium <i>Anicetum</i> of this
stamp derives its name from being a preparation containing aniseed.
But the formula given by Oribasius does not present this
ingredient; and the origin of the term is, we believe, very different.
Galen presents us with a clue to its true meaning, when
discussing the subject of plasters, in the sixth book of his work,
<i>De Compositione Medicamentorum</i>. One, bearing the name of
<span class="smcap lowercase">ANICETUM</span>, is (he observes) called so in consequence of its many and
wonderful effects (vocatum est insuperabilis (&#913;&#925;&#921;&#922;&#919;&#932;&#927;&#925;) propter
miranda et multa ipsius opera).<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a> The term itself is, no doubt, derived
from the Greek participle &#957;&#953;&#954;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#8220;conquered,&#8221; with the prefix
of the privative &#945;. Among his own list of collyria, Galen enters
the one known in his time under the name of Collyrium Aster,<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> as
unsurpassed (&#913;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961; &#913;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#957;<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span></p><p>2. <span class="smcap lowercase">T. VINDAC.&mdash;ARIOVISTI NARDINUM.</span>&mdash;<i>T. Vindacius Ariovistus'
Nardinum</i> or <i>Spikenard Collyrium</i>.</p>

<p>The ancient authorities on the Materia Medica describe several
kinds of spikenard, according to the localities in which it is procured,
as the Indian, Syrian, Celtic, etc. It was used by the
Romans in many of their ointments and perfumes,<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> and sometimes
added to their wines.<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a></p>

<p>The nard, or spikenard, was used principally to perfume various
medicines, etc. But high medicinal properties were also attributed
to it in various diseases, and, amongst others, in diseases of the eye.
(See Dioscorides, lib. i. cap. vi.) It entered into the composition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>of many of the ancient collyria, and several were named from it in
consequence of its forming their leading ingredient. Aetius has a
long chapter on formul&aelig; for &#8220;Collyria Nardina et Theodotia,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a>
and bestows the most extravagant praises upon some varieties
of the spikenard eye-applications. Speaking of one of them, he
observes, &#8220;It is not easy to relate the powers and efficiency of this
medicine; indeed my readers would scarcely credit it, for under
the most desperate affections it recalls the eye to its natural state.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a></p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap lowercase">T. VINDAC. ARIOVISTI CHLORON.</span>&mdash;<i>The Chloron</i> or <i>green Collyrium
of T. Vindax Ariovistus</i>.</p>

<p>Already I have had occasion to allude to the collyrium <i>Chloron</i>,
as one of those which derive their particular appellation from the
tint or colour of the preparation. The green collyrium, or <i>Chloron</i>,
is mentioned in many of the old treatises upon affections of the
eye. For example, Galen gives several such collyria in succession,
as, vol. xii. pp. 763 and 768, the &#8220;<i>Chloron</i> ad diatheses;&#8221; and
again, two forms of <i>Chloron</i> used by Zoilus the oculist.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap lowercase">T. VINDAC. ARIOVISTI</span> <i>Tu</i><span class="smcap lowercase">RINUM</span>. <i>The Frankincense Collyrium
of T. Vindacius Ariovistus.</i></p>

<p>The designation of the collyrium on this fourth side of the
Kenchester stone is so very much destroyed as to render the
deciphering of it extremely difficult and problematical.</p>

<p>Mr. Roach Smith has not attempted to read it; but has con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>tented
himself by giving N as the last letter of the collyrium, and
the only one capable of being deciphered, printing the whole legend
on this side thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">T VINDAC. ARIO<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VISTI<span class="gesperrt"> ..... </span>N.<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a>
</p>

<p>But certainly the terminal letter is not <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>. Mr. Johnson has kindly
supplied me with two wax impressions of the legend on this side.
One of these is faithfully copied in Plate III., No. X., lowest
figure. The examination of it will show that the terminal letter
is not an <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>; for the supposed middle or oblique line of the letter
descends downwards from left to right, and not, as it should do,
provided the letter were <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>, from right to left. The two first letters
of the name of the collyrium are entirely obliterated. In the position
of the third letter there is the head of a letter which may
stand for <span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span>. The following letter is apparently an <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>; and
the next an <span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>. In reading it, I have supposed these three consecutive
letters to be <span class="smcap lowercase">RIN</span>, and the terminal letter to be an <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>, or
rather a <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span> braced together. An instance of a similar
bracing or conjunction of two letters is seen in the legend of the
second side of this stone, where the terminal two letters <span class="smcap lowercase">TI</span> of
&#8220;<i>Ariovisti</i>&#8221; are conjoined into one. Further, I have ventured to
suggest the two initial letters as <span class="smcap lowercase">TU</span>, and the whole name as consequently
<span class="smcap lowercase">TURINUM</span>.</p>

<p>The collyrium <i>Thurinum</i>, or <i>Turinum</i>, is inscribed on three
Roman medicine-stamps that have been discovered in France,&mdash;the
first in Paris, the second at Cessi-sur-Tille, and the third at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Solangei. The two last are both described by M. Fevret de Saint-Mesmin.<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a>
The collyrium evidently derived its specific name from
its principal ingredient frankincense, or <i>thus</i>, this latter Roman
noun being sometimes spelt with, and sometimes without, the <i>h</i>.
In the Solangei stamp the collyrium is written <span class="smcap lowercase">THURINUM</span>; but in
the stamps of Paris and Cessi-sur-Tille it appears without the <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>,
or as <span class="smcap lowercase">TURINUM</span>.</p>

<p>The collyrium <i>Turinum</i> is, it is scarcely necessary to add, merely
a latinised form for the Greek collyrium <i>Dialibanum</i>, the composition
and virtues of which we have considered in the previous
pages (see pp. 269 and 283). The Latin translators of Oribasius and
Paulus &AElig;gineta render the collyrium Dialibanum as written by
these Greek authors by the term &#8220;<i>Collyrium ex thure</i>.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> In the
same way the &#954;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959; &#948;&#953;&#945; &#955;&#953;&#946;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#965; &#947;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; of Galen is rendered
by K&uuml;hn, and his other translators, as &#8220;Collyrium quod fit ex

<h3>SECTION XII.</h3>

<p class="center3">STAMP NO. XI.&mdash;FOUND AT CIRENCESTER.</p>

<p>In the beautiful work on the Roman remains of Cirencester,
published last year by Professor Buckman and Mr. Newmarch, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>Roman medicine-stamp is described.<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a> It was found, in 1818, in
the Leauses garden at Cirencester, deposited in a fictile urn.</p>

<p>This stamp is of the form of a parallelogram, and is inscribed
on two of its sides. Plate III., No. XI., shows the lettering of
these two inscriptions, as well as the size of the sides, and the rude
cross-markings that appear on the two ends of the stone. The inscriptions
are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">1. MINERVALIS DIALEB</div>
<div class="line i1">ANUM AD IMPT LIPP EX OVO</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">2. MINERVALIS MELINU</div>
<div class="line i1">AD OMNEM DOLOREM</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Messrs. Buckman and Newmarch read <span class="smcap lowercase">MINERVALIS</span> as signifying
&#8220;pertaining to Minerva;&#8221; but it is no doubt the name, as in
other specimens, of the oculist who was the proprietor of the stamp.
And from the inscriptions left us upon Roman tombs, we know
that <i>Minervalis</i> was a Roman cognomen.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a></p>

<p>The two inscriptions are easily read; they are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap lowercase">MINERVALIS DIALEBANUM AD IMPET</span><i>um</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">LIPP</span><i>itudinis</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">EX OVO</span>.&mdash;<i>Minervalis'
frankincense Collyrium for attacks of Ophthalmy; to
be used with an egg.</i></p>

<p>We have already had occasion to discuss the nature of the Collyrium
Dialibanum (p. 269), and it is unnecessary to recur to it.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
On a previous occasion, also (p. 284), the signification of the
common expression, <i>ex ovo</i>, was adverted to.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap lowercase">MINERVALIS MELINU</span><i>m</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">AD OMNEM DOLOREM.</span>&mdash;<i>Minervalis'
yellow Collyrium for every pain or disease of the eye.</i></p>

<p>More than once we have had occasion to allude to the Collyrium
<i>Melinum</i> (pp. 250, 257). The only singularity in the present instance
is, that we have here the <i>Melinum</i> offered as a panacea for
every painful affection to which the eyes of the colonists and
natives of Cirencester might be subject, at the time that <span class="smcap">Minervalis</span>
practised amongst them. One of the forms of the Collyrium
<i>Melinum</i> given by Galen is professed by him to be efficacious &#8220;ad
omnem oculorum hebetudinem.&#8221;&mdash;(K&uuml;hn&#8217;s edit. vol. xii. p. 786.)</p>

<h3>SECTION XIII.</h3>

<p class="center3">STAMP NO. XII.&mdash;FOUND IN IRELAND.</p>

<p>A Roman medicine-stamp has lately turned up in these islands,
in a locality in which its presence could be little expected&mdash;viz.,
in the county of Tipperary, in Ireland. It has been described by
Mr. Albert Way in an interesting paper, published after the first
part of the present essay appeared in the <i>Monthly Journal of
Medical Science</i>.<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> Dr. Dowsley, of Clonmel, who now possesses
this stone, has kindly furnished me with a wax impression of its
inscription, and with the following note relative to the locality in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>which it was discovered:&mdash;&#8220;It was found (he says) near the village
of Golden, parish of Relig-Murry, in the county of Tipperary, in
a field near the ruins of an old hospital, or at least what was supposed
to be such; but it was built at so remote a period, that there
is now no record of what the building was for, nor of the founder
of it, and so little of the walls are at present standing, that even
the style of architecture cannot be known. The seal was discovered
by a labourer when digging. There was no pottery nor
coin found; but near it was a human skeleton much decayed, the
position of which in the ground was not noticed. The soil in this
field is peculiarly rich and very deep; it is frequently carted away
for manure; most likely it was an ancient burial-ground. The
village of Golden is about a mile from the old Abbey of Athassel.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to discuss here how such a Roman relic
reached this part of Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> and whether it was conveyed there
or not when the Romans were colonising Britain; or, what is probable,
at a later period. But I may merely remark, there can be
no doubt that Roman civilisation and Roman practices spread in
the earlier centuries of the Christian era to parts beyond the precise
line of Roman conquest. Other Roman relics have been found
in Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> though Ireland was never subject to the Roman arms;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>and Roman vases, ornaments, and coins, have been discovered even
in those more distant and northern Scandinavian settlements, to
which the Roman power never penetrated.<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a></p>

<p>Plate III., No. XII., shows the figure of this Irish medicine-stamp.
It is engraved only on one side, and the inscription runs
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">M IUVEN TUTIANI</div>
<div class="line">DIAMYSUS AD VET CIC</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>(<i>arci?</i>) <span class="smcap lowercase">JUVEN</span><i>tii</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">TUTIANI DIAMYSUS AD VET</span><i>eres</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">CIC</span><i>atrices</i>.&mdash;<i>The
Diamysus of Marcus Juventius Tutianus, for old cicatrices.</i></p>

<p>At the end of the first line there is a small cut in the inscription
(see Plate), which, in all probability, is not a letter, but a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>mark or ornament intended to fill up that space. If a letter, it is
most likely C, standing perhaps for collyrium.</p>

<p>In speaking of the Bath stone, I have already taken occasion to
state that this same inscription of <i>Diamysus ad veteres cicatrices</i>
has now been found on various Roman medicine-stamps discovered
in different parts of France.</p>

<p>The collyrium <span class="smcap lowercase">DIAMISYOS</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">DIAMYSOS</span> derived its designation
from containing as its principal ingredient the <i>Misy</i>, a metallic
vitriolic preparation, used to a considerable extent as a stimulant
and escharotic among the ancients; and it was retained even to a
comparatively late period in the London Pharmacop&oelig;ia.<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> It
appears to be still used medicinally in the East.<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a></p>

<p>The chemical nature, however, of <i>Misy</i> has given rise to some
considerable doubt and discussion. It was usually found, and
generally described, along with two other cognate fossils, <i>Sori</i> and
<i>Chalcitis</i>. And Galen, who enters into an elaborate description of
them, visited the copper mines of Cyprus, with a view of determining
the precise nature of these three mineral substances.<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p><p>Dr. Adams,<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a> who has examined this question with all his well-known
great learning and care, believes that these three minerals
were merely varieties of <i>chalcanthum</i> or copperas. In his opinion
the <i>Chalcitis</i> was probably a kind of pure sulphate of copper which
had contracted an efflorescence from age; the <i>Sori</i> was sulphate
of copper combined with zinc or other impurities; and the <i>Misy</i>
was a combination of sulphate of copper with sulphate of iron,
the predominance of the chalybeate salt giving to the fossil its
peculiar colour. For the Misy, says Dioscorides, is &#8220;of a golden
appearance, hard, shining like gold when broken, and glancing
like stars.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his remarks on the <i>Misy</i>, Dioscorides speaks of the analogy
of its caustic power with those of Chalcitis; but the only diseases
that he referred to as having the <i>Misy</i> used in their treatment, are
the diseases of the eye. And he does so in telling us that the
Egyptian kind of <i>Misy</i> is quite inferior to the Cyprian in forming
eye-medicines (ocularia medicamenta).<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a></p>

<p>In speaking of its medical powers, Galen,<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a> Oribasius,<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> and
Paulus &AElig;gineta,<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a> describe the <i>Misy</i> as escharotic, and astringent.
In giving his list of eye-medicines, Galen places the <i>Misy</i>, <i>Sori</i>,
etc., amongst those local applications which have a detergent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>effect.<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> Paulus &AElig;gineta enters the <i>Misy</i> in his list of &#8220;detergents
of foul ulcers&#8221; of the eye (vol. iii. p. 548). Pliny, in describing
the properties of Misy, states that &#8220;extenuat scabrities oculorum.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a>
Celsus in his work repeatedly alludes to the <i>Misy</i> and its effects.<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a>
One of the collyria which he describes when treating of granular
ophthalmia, contains the <i>Misy</i> (see page 294). And he adds, that
with the exception of those affections which require mild applications,
this special collyrium is adapted to every kind of disorder
of the eye (adversus omne genus oculorum valetudinis idoneum
est). Galen (vol. xii. p. 736), Oribasius (lib. iv. p. 51), and Paulus
&AElig;gineta (vol. iii. 556), all give formul&aelig; for the collyrium <span class="smcap">Panchrestos</span>
of Erasistratus, which contained <i>Misy</i> as its leading
ingredient. &#8220;It has,&#8221; says Paulus, &#8220;wonderful efficacy in diseases
of the eyes.&#8221; Oribasius enters it as a &#8220;compositio admirabilis.&#8221;
The <i>Misy</i>, as a reputed &#8220;valedissimum medicamentum,&#8221;
enters as an ingredient into several of the collyria described by
Actuarius.<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a></p>

<p>In a previous page I have already taken occasion to state that
Marcellus Empiricus gives a formula for a collyrium under the
name inscribed upon the stone of the collyrium <span class="smcap lowercase">DIAMISYOS</span>; and
he describes it as calculated &#8220;ad aspritudines oculorum tollendas
et ad lachrymas substringendas.&#8221;</p>

<p>The collyrium <i>Diamisyos</i> of Marcellus Empiricus consists of
<i>Misy</i> burnt till it becomes red, and then combined with spikenard,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298-300</a></span>saffron, cadmia, calcined copper, opium, myrrh, Cyprian scales,
and gum, with all which it was to be rubbed down in the best
wine, shaken and filtered. But he gives also the alternative of
adding to the <i>Diamysos</i> another ingredient, which was long an
article in the materia medica&mdash;viz. vipers. For some (he observes)
add to the collyrium <i>Diamisyos</i> &#8220;a viper, dried and baked well in
the sun, as if it were salted&#8221; (quidam adjiciunt huic collyrio
viperam siccam et arefactam bene in sole tanquam si sit salita).
He goes on, however, still further to explain that prayers and
incantations must be used in making this addition to the <i>Diamisyos</i>.
For (he observes) if you thus wish to add the dried viper,
you must first extract its bones, roll it up in linen, and then pour
over it the wine of the collyrium, previously charming the viper
(sed prius eam praecantabis) as follows, lest it cause tears and
produce harm, saying, &#8220;As thou dost not see, even so may thy
juice, when tasted, hurt no one, but I pray that with the purpose
for which thou hast been added, thou mayest<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> further the cure
(quomodo tu non vides, sic et tuus succus gustatus nulli noceat,
sed ob rem propter quam adjecta es proficias bene curationi,
precor).&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a></p>

<h2>ANTIQUARIAN NOTICES OF SYPHILIS
IN SCOTLAND.</h2>

<h3>PART I.</h3>

<p>Medical men are, for the most part, agreed upon two points in
relation to the history of syphilis&mdash;viz. that it is a species of
disease which was unknown to the Greek, Roman, and Arabian
physicians; and that it first began to prevail in Europe in the
later years of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The non-existence of syphilis in ancient times, and the circumstance
of its original appearance in Europe about the date alluded
to, are opinions strongly borne out by two sets of facts. For, first,
no definite account of this marked and extraordinary species of
disease is to be found in the writings of any one of the ancient
Greek or Roman physicians, historians, or poets; and, secondly, of
the numerous authors whose works exist in the learned collections
of Luisinus,<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> Astruc,<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a> and Girtanner,<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a> and who saw and described
the malady in the later years of the fifteenth or commencement of
the sixteenth century, almost all comment upon it as (to use their
own general expressions) <i>morbus novus, morbus ignotus, &aelig;gritudo</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span><i>inaudita, &aelig;gritudo nova, malum novum, novus et nostro orbe incognitus
morbus</i>, etc. etc.<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a></p>

<p>It would not, however, affect our present object were we to
consider the disease, as it appeared about the period in question,
not to have been a new malady previously totally unknown, but
merely, as some have thought, an aggravated form of a disease
formerly existing in so mild a form as not to have attracted general
observation.</p>

<p>Nor need I stop here to inquire into the much more difficult
questions of the probable source of syphilis, and the exact date at
which syphilis first burst forth in Europe. In relation to the
object which I have at present in view, it matters not whether the
malady sprang up spontaneously and endemically in Spain, Italy,
or France, at the era in question; or was imported from Africa, as
Gr&uuml;ner,<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> Infessura,<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a> and others allege; or from Hispaniola, as
Astruc,<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a> Girtanner,<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a> Weatherhead,<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> and various other authorities,
have stoutly and not unsuccessfully maintained. Nor is it necessary
for me to discuss whether it first showed itself in 1493, as
Sanchez<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> and Hensler<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a> consider that they have proved; or in
1492, as Fulgosi<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> asserts; or as early even as the month of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>October 1483, as Peter Pinctor,<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a> in 1500, demonstrated astrologically,
to his own complete satisfaction at least, that it ought to
have done, inasmuch as that was&mdash;as he sagaciously convinced
himself&mdash;the precise and exact date of the conjunction of Venus
with Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury; and the conjunction of these or
other stars in the heavens above, was&mdash;so he and many of the
astrological physicians of his day believed&mdash;the undoubted origin
of this new scourge on the earth below.</p>

<p>In such a notice as the present, we may most safely, I believe,
and that too without entertaining the question of the exact source
or geographical origin of syphilis, start from the general proposition
that the disease was in 1494 and 1495 first distinctly recognised
in Italy, during the invasion of that country by the victorious
army of Charles VIII. of France. The malady is usually allowed
to have first broken out in a very marked degree at Naples, about
the time that Charles took possession of that city, in the spring of
1495; or nearly two years after Columbus&#8217; return from his first
voyage to Hispaniola. Charles set out again for France in May
1495; and the malady seems to have been both diffused by his
infected troops along the line of their northward march, and
afterwards carried to their respective homes by his own French
soldiers, as well as by his various Swiss, German, and Flemish
auxiliaries.</p>

<p class="tb">But it is as little my intention at present to trace the progress
as to ascertain the first origin of syphilis in Europe. The chief
object of the present communication is to adduce some data which
show that the new malady was not long in reaching the shores of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Scotland, and in spreading to different towns in that kingdom. In
proof of this, I have principally to appeal to one or two old edicts
and ordinances relative to the disease, and to other collateral but
slighter evidence bearing upon the subject. The edicts or statutes
in question were issued by the Town-Council of Aberdeen, in relation
to the existence of the malady in Aberdeen; and by the Privy
Council of Scotland, in relation to the prevalence of the disease in
Edinburgh. The two first edicts in both places were issued in
1497. That of Aberdeen is the earlier. It is dated the 21st of
April 1497. Its words, as they stand in the old and carefully preserved
Council Records of that city,<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The said day, it was statut and ordanit be the Alderman and
Consale for the eschevin <i>of the infirmitey cumm out of Franche and
strang partis</i>, that all licht weman be chargit and ordanit to decist

skalit, and thai to pas and wirk for thar sustentacioun vndir the
payne of ane key of het yrne one thair chekis, and banysene of the
toune.&#8221; (Vol. i. p. 425.)</p>

<p>A few years later&mdash;or on the 8th October 1507&mdash;a long list of
statutes was passed by the &#8220;Prouest, bailyes, and counsale&#8221; of
Aberdeen, for the &#8220;common proffitt, weil, and gud reull of the
burgh.&#8221; Two of these statutes refer again to the introduction and
spread of syphilis. By the first of these statutes it was enacted
&#8220;That diligent inquisitioun be takin of ale infect personis with this
strange <i>seiknes of Nappillis</i>, for the sauetie of the town; and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>personis beand infectit therwith be chargit to keip thaime in their
howssis and vther places fra the haill folkis.&#8221; (Vol. i. p. 437.)</p>

<p>Two or three enactments follow in the &#8220;statut buk&#8221; on minor
subjects, one ordering the hygienic measure &#8220;that thar salbe certane
personis to cleng the toun and dicht the causaies;&#8221; and then succeeds
another sanitary ordinance relative to the avoidance of
syphilis&mdash;viz. &#8220;That nayne infeccht folkis with the <i>seiknes of
Napillis</i> be haldin at the common fleschouss, or with the fleschouris,
baxteris, brousteris, ladinaris, for sauete of the toun, and the
personis infectit sale keip thame quyat in thar houssis, zhardis, or
vther comat placis, quhill thai be haill, for the infectioun of their
nichtbouris.&#8221; (P. 437.)</p>

<p class="tb">The Edinburgh edict regarding syphilis was six months later
in date than the first of those issued by the magistrates of Aberdeen,
and is more lengthy in its details and provisions. It was
drawn up, as I have already said, by the King&#8217;s Privy Council, and
apparently sent to the magistrates for due execution. It is preserved
in the first volume of the <i>Town Records of Edinburgh</i>,
fol. 33, 34, and is entitled in the rubric &#8220;Ane Grangore Act;&#8221;&mdash;Grandgore
being an early term often applied to syphilis in Scotland.
This edict has been repeatedly printed, but usually in a very
incorrect form. The exact date and words of it are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;xxii Septembris anno i<sup>ai</sup> iiii<sup>c</sup> lxxxxvii zeiris. It is our
Souerane Lordis will and the command of the Lordis of his Counsale

<p>It is almost unnecessary to add that the measures adopted by
the public authorities in Aberdeen and Edinburgh were utterly inadequate
to arrest the further dissemination of syphilis after it
was inoculated upon the country. It seems indeed to have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>spread to the more populous towns of Scotland within a year or
two after its first introduction into the kingdom. There are some
references in official documents of the period which incidentally
but amply prove this rapidity in its diffusion.</p>

<p>The notices to which I here specially refer exist in the Accounts
of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland. The Register House,
Edinburgh, contains a curious and valuable series of these Accounts,
detailing the daily expenses of the kings of Scotland from the
reign of James III. down to the ascension of the English throne
by James VI. At the time of the first appearance of syphilis in
our northern realm, the throne of Scotland was occupied by
James IV., a prince who was a great patron of the arts and sciences
of his time. He was a practitioner in them also, as well as a
patron of them. At different times we find him busily experimenting
in chemistry, in physiology, and in medicine. His daily
expense-books contain many entries of purchases for instruments
and materials to make the unmakeable &#8220;quinta essentia,&#8221; or philosopher&#8217;s
stone; and he had laboratories for these investigations
both at Edinburgh and Stirling. His alchemical assistant&mdash;John
the Leeche&mdash;whom he had imported from the Continent and made
Abbot of Tungland, experimented for the king in physiology as well
as in chemistry. John, D&aelig;dalus-like, undertook to prove the improvability
of human progression by flying to France with wings.
&#8220;To that effect he causet (states Bishop Lesley<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a>) mak ane pair of
wingis of fedderis, quhilkis beand fessinit apoun him, he flew off
the castell wall of Striveling, but shortly he fell to the ground and
brak his thee bane.&#8221; But the doctrine of sympathies was in vogue
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>in these days, and by that doctrine the afflicted Abbot easily, of
course, and clearly explained all. For the cause of his fall, or
&#8220;the wyt thairof he asscryvit to that thair was sum hen fedderis
in the wingis, quhilk yarnit and covet the mydding and not the
skyis.&#8221; Like the Egyptian king mentioned by Herodotus, King
James made also a physiological or rather philological experiment
to ascertain the primeval language of mankind; and for this purpose
his Majesty sent a deaf and dumb woman to live with and
bring up two young children upon the island of Inchkeith in the
Firth of Forth&mdash;the same island to which we have found the first
victims of syphilis previously banished, and itself the old &#8220;Urbs
Guidi&#8221; of the venerable Bede. When the two children, the companions
of the &#8220;dumb voman cam to the aige of perfyte speach,
some sayes&#8221; (to quote the account of Lindsay of Pitscottie) &#8220;they
spak guid Hebrew;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> but the cautious old Scottish chronicler
sagely doubts the truth of this tradition. King James personally
practised the art of leechcraft, as well as experimented in alchemy
and physiology. &#8220;He was,&#8221; says Pitscottie, &#8220;weill learned in the
airt of medicine, and was ane singular guid chirurgiane; and
thair was none of that professioune, if they had any dangerous
cure in hand, bot would have craved his adwyse&#8221; (p. 249). So
states the ancient Scottish historian. The High Treasurer&#8217;s Account
shows that the king had in one important respect a right
royal way of gaining patients,&mdash;a way by the adoption of which he
probably might have secured a considerable consultation and private
practice even in these modern days of high-pressure rivalry, and
keen competition. For he paid his patients, instead of being paid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>by them. Thus, for example, in his daily expense-book, under the
date of April 14th and 15th, 1491, are the two following entries:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Item to Domenico to gif the king leve to lat him blud, xviii
shillings.&#8221; &#8220;Item til a man yat come to Lythgow to lat the king
blud and did it nocht, xviii shillings.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">Some time afterwards he buys from a travelling pedlar &#8220;thre
compases, ane hammer, and a turcase to tak out teeth;&#8221; and forthwith,
we find the Scottish king becoming&mdash;like the more modern
Peter the Great of Russia&mdash;not a dentist to royalty, but himself a
royal dentist, as the two following entries may suffice to show (the
first of them&mdash;provided there be any truth whatever in dental
orthography&mdash;surely indicating a tooth of rather a tough and
tusky character):&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Item, to ane fallow, because the king pullit furtht his twtht,
xviii shillings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Item, to Kynnard, ye barbour, for tua teith drawin furtht of
his hed be the king, xviii shillings.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">He seems to have tried his royal hand also at ocular surgery.
But the terms of the following entry would seem rather ominously
to hint that he was not a very successful operator for cataract:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tb">&#8220;Item, giffin to ye blind wif yat hed her eyne schorne, xiii
shillings.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">A prince imbued with such medical and surgical propensities
would naturally feel deeply interested in the first appearance within
his realm of such a malady as syphilis; and in his Treasurer&#8217;s
accounts there are several entries indicating that the king had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
bestowed monies upon various persons affected with this disease.
Perhaps these monies were given less in the way of alms than in
the way of a reward for the king&#8217;s medication of the patients; less
for the behoof of royal charity than of royal chirurgery. The entries
I advert to all occur during the currency of the years 1497 and
1498.<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> They are as follows:&mdash;the first sum given away being to a
person at Dalry, when the king was on one of his many pilgrimages
to the ancient and holy shrine of St.&nbsp;Ninian at Whitehorn, in
Wigtownshire.</p>

In the course of the preceding remarks I have had occasion to
adduce seven or eight different notices with regard to the appearance
of syphilis in various cities and districts of Scotland during
the years 1497-8, as at Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling,
Linlithgow, etc. A diversity of allusions to the same disease, of a
less direct and official character, and somewhat later in date, may
be traced in various olden Scottish works and writings. The
malady is occasionally alluded to, for example, in the reports left
us of some of the old criminal and other trials of Scotland. Thus
a minute in the Records of the Privy Seal of Scotland records the
punishment of a medical man in whose hands a dignitary of the
church had died while under treatment for syphilis. The entry is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tb">January 18th, 1509.&mdash;&#8220;Respitt made to Thomas Lyn, burges of
Edinburgh, for ye slauchtir of umquihile Schir Lancelote Patonsoun,
chapellain, quhilk happinit be negligent cure and medicine yat ye
said Thomas tuk one him to cure and hele ye said umquhile Schir
Lancelote of ye infirmitie of ye Grantgor yat he was infekkit with.
To endure for xix yeeris. (Subscripsit per dominum Regem apud
Edinburghe.)&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a></p>

<p class="tb">Some, perhaps, of my professional brethren may think that this
nineteen years&#8217; banishment from the town was a proper punishment
for an unprofessional charlatan undertaking the cure of syphilis in
the sixteenth century; and some, possibly, may even hold, that it
would not be an improper proceeding in this&mdash;the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>
<p>The disease is alluded to in some of the old Scotch witch trials
of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable of these trials was that of a lady
of station and wealth&mdash;Euphame Macalzane, daughter of Lord
Cliftonhall, a judge of the Court of Session. Among other matters,
she was &#8220;indyted and accusit&#8221; of using, during the birth of her
two sons, an&aelig;sthetics in the form of charms, and a fairy stone
&#8220;layit under the bowster,&#8221; whereby, in the words of the dittay,
&#8220;your seiknes was cassin of you unnaturallie, in the birth of your
fyrst sone upon ane dog, quhilk ranne away and wes newir sene
agane. And in the birth of your last sone, the same prakteis foirsaid
wes usit, and your naturall and kindlie payne, unnaturallie
cassin of you uponn the wantonne cat in the house, quhilk lyke wyis
wes newer sene thair efter.&#8221; In the fourteenth item of her indictment
she is accused of trying to break off a marriage by &#8220;certane
witchcraft,&#8221; and by alleging that the intended bridegroom had the
&#8220;glengore.&#8221; For these and other analogous crimes this unfortunate
lady was &#8220;takin to the Castel-Hill of Edinburghe, and thair bund
to ane staik, and brunt in assis, quick to the death.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a></p>

<p>There are also various sarcastic allusions to syphilis by the
Scottish poets of these early days, amply testifying to the fact of
its rapid diffusion both among the followers of the court&mdash;who were
then the most common objects of poetical satire&mdash;and among the
community at large.</p>

<p>William Dunbar, the flower of the old Scottish poets, was, at
the period of the first introduction of syphilis in 1497, in the prime
of manhood; and in two or three years afterwards, viz. in 1500,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>he was attached to James IV. and his court by an annual state
pension. In a number of verses addressed to his patroness, Margaret,
the Queen of James IV. and the sister of Henry VIII.&mdash;verses
which appear to us at the present day, and with our existing
standards of taste, as utterly degraded and indecent&mdash;Dunbar commemorates
the communication of the new disease under the name
of the &#8220;pockis&#8221; and the &#8220;Spanyie pokis,&#8221; to the Queen&#8217;s men (as
he terms them) during the jollities of Fastern&#8217;s e&#8217;en, and the reign
of the Abbot of Unreason; and he closes his stanzas with an
earnest advice to all youths, to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i05">&#8220;Be ware with that perrelous play</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>The after effects and consequences of the disease he describes as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line i1">For ower oft libbing of the Pockis.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another and later poet of that age, Sir David Lyndsay of the
Mount, alludes to the occurrence of syphilis at the Christmas feasts
in an inferior officer of the court&mdash;viz. in John Mackrery, the king&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>&#8220;fule,&#8221; or royal jester, who, according to the poet&mdash;like many a

</div></div></div>

<p>The same author includes this disease elsewhere (p. 147) among
the maladies</p>

<p>A metrical translation of Hector Boece&#8217;s <i>History of Scotland</i>
was made in the earlier half of the sixteenth century, apparently
by command of James V. It has been published for the first time,
within the last two years, under the authority and direction of the
Master of the Rolls. The author of this rhyming <i>Buik of the
Chronicles of Scotland</i>, William Stewart, when translating Boece&#8217;s
account of the fatal disease produced in the old mythical Scotch
king, Ferquhard, by the bite of a wolf, tells us (vol. ii. p. 313) that
the resulting gangrenous wound defied the skill of the leiches, and
the f&oelig;tor of it, and its discharges were</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>In the celebrated old poem of the <i>General Satire of Scotland</i>,
attributed by most authorities to Dunbar, and which, from some
circumstances adverted to in the course of it, is supposed by Sibbald
and Chalmers to have been written in 1504 (seven years after
the first introduction of syphilis), the author deplores the extent to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>which the disease had by that time already spread in Scotland,
observing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="line i05">&#8220;Sic losing sarkis, so mony Glengoir markis,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>In several of the notices which I have just quoted, the new
disease, syphilis, is alluded to under the names of &#8220;Gor,&#8221; &#8220;Gore,&#8221;
&#8220;Grandgore,&#8221; etc. Few maladies have been loaded with a more
varied and more extensive nomenclature. The terms in question,
&#8220;Gore&#8221; and &#8220;Grandgore,&#8221; are of French origin, and are old names
corresponding to pox and great pox&mdash;&#8220;verole&#8221; and &#8220;grand verole.&#8221;
In the earlier periods of the history of syphilis they were terms
commonly employed by the French themselves to designate the
affection. To quote one confirmatory sentence from Astruc (p. 1166),
the disease &#8220;Gore et Grandgore a Gallis initio vocata erat.&#8221; John
le Maire, in his celebrated poem on syphilis, published in 1520,
gives this as one of the designations of the disease used at that time
by the commonalty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i05">&#8220;La nommoit Gorre ou la verole grosse,</div>
<div class="line">Qui n&#8217;espargnoit ne couronne ne crosse.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Old Rabelais, whose <i>Gargantua</i> and <i>Pantagruel</i> are perfect
repositories of the low and licentious French words of the era at
which syphilis first appeared, uses the term Grandgore as a synonym
for syphilis; and in his wild allegorical style he makes the poor
and widowed poet, Rammagrobis, take this grandgore to bed for his
second wife. The term Grandgore seems to have been applied to
the disease in Scotland for a long time after its introduction. For
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>example, the author of the <i>Historie of the Kennedys</i> quotes a letter
written in the latter part of the sixteenth century by the Laird of
Colzean to the Laird of Bargany, whose &#8220;neise was laich,&#8221; maliciously
suggesting to him that yet he might lose &#8220;sum uther joynt
of the Glengoir, as ye did the brig of your neise.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a> Still later, or
in 1600, the Kirk-Session of Glasgow requested the magistrates &#8220;to
consult the chirurgeons how the infectious distemper of Glengore
could be removed from the city.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a></p>

<p>In Scotland, as elsewhere, the disease also passed under other
designations. When syphilis first broke out it was frequently, as
is well known, designated from the country or people from whom
it was supposed to have been transmitted. Thus, the Italians and
Germans at first generally spoke of it as the French disease; while
the French talked of it as the disease of Naples; and the Dutch,
Flemings, Portuguese, and Moors, applied to it the name of the
Spanish pocks or Castilian malady. Dunbar, in the Scottish poem
already alluded to as addressed to Queen Margaret, speaks of it, in
most of the stanzas, under the simple title of &#8220;pockis,&#8221; but in one
he gives it, as I have already hinted, the distinctive and significant
appellation of the Spanish pocks:&mdash;</p>

<p>In two of the Aberdeen Town-Council entries we have already
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>seen the malady spoken of as &#8220;the sickness of Naples.&#8221; This
name was at first often applied to the malady. The disease was,
however, much more generally known in Scotland and in the other
kingdoms of Europe under the name of the French pox. The first
Aberdeen edict speaks of it in 1497 as the &#8220;infirmity come out of
France.&#8221; In the manuscript Session Records of the parish of
Ormiston for 1662, there is an entry regarding the malady under
the appellation of the French pox, one of the minutes being&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The minister, Mr. Sinclair, hath given out to James Ogilvy,
apothecary-chirurgeon, for curing William Whitly, his wife and
daughter, of the French pockis, 35 lbs. Scots.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grunbeck and Brandt, who wrote on syphilis in 1496, when
speaking of the diffusion of the disease at that early date over
Europe, both allude in very vague and general terms to its having
invaded France, Germany, etc., and reached as far as Britain.<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a>
But the earliest specific notice of syphilis in England which I remember
to have met with is in 1502; and in this notice the
malady is spoken of under the same name that I have been adverting
to, of &#8220;French pox.&#8221; The notice in question is contained
in the interesting Privy Purse Expense Book of Elizabeth of York,
the queen of Henry VII., edited by Sir Harris Nicolas. This
charitable lady seems from these records to have had several
prot&eacute;g&eacute;s under her immediate care and keeping. Among these
prot&eacute;g&eacute;s is entered John Pertriche, one &#8220;of the sonnes of mad
Beale.&#8221; There are various articles of expenditure noted in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
Queen&#8217;s private expense book as lavished upon this John Pertriche
during the currency of 1503; as monies for his &#8220;dyetts,&#8221;
for buying &#8220;shirtes,&#8221; &#8220;shoyn,&#8221; and &#8220;hosyn,&#8221; &#8220;cloth for a gown,&#8221;
and &#8220;fustyan for a cote&#8221; to him. There are twenty pence expended
&#8220;for his lernyng;&#8221; and the last two items in the account
record attempts of two different and rather opposite kinds to
amend the mental and moral deficiencies of this hopeful youth.
These two ultimate items are&mdash;</p>
<p class="tb">
&#8220;For a prymer and saulter (book to John), 20 pence.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;And payed to a Surgeon whiche heled him of the Frenche
pox, 20 shillings.&#8221;<br />
</p>

<p class="tb">To finish this very rough and meagre sketch, let me here add
that by the end of the sixteenth century&mdash;and perhaps long before
that date&mdash;the malady was abundant enough in England. Writing
in 1596, or in the time of Queen Elizabeth, William Clowes,
&#8220;one of her Majesties chirurgians,&#8221; observes to his &#8220;friendly
reader,&#8221; &#8220;If I be not deceived in mine opinion, I suppose the
disease itselfe was never more rife in Naples, Italie, France, or
Spain, than it is in this day in the Realme of England.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a></p>

<h3>PART II.</h3>

<p>The preceding notices, however brief and imperfect, relative to
the first introduction and dissemination of syphilis in Scotland, are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>not simply matters calculated to gratify mere antiquarian curiosity.
They appear to me to be capable of a much higher application,
for they offer so many elements tending to illustrate the general
history of the first appearance of syphilis in Europe. Besides, we
may, I believe, be justified in drawing from the data they afford
several not uninteresting nor unimportant corollaries, both in regard
to the first origin and mode of propagation of the disease, and
the distinction of it from other affections with which it has sometimes
been confounded.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>1st Corollary.</i>&mdash;These notices tend to corroborate the pathological
opinion, that syphilis was a species of disease new to
Europe when it first excited the attention of physicians and
historians in the last years of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Like the numerous list of contemporary authors and physicians
quoted by Astruc, Gr&uuml;ner, and Weatherhead, the Aberdeen edict
speaks of syphilis in the last years of the fifteenth century as a
disease hitherto unknown, &#8220;the infirmity come out of France and
foreign parts.&#8221; The Edinburgh edict mentions it as &#8220;<i>a</i> contagious
disease callit the grandgore.&#8221; If it had been previously known,
the definite, and not the indefinite, article would have, in all probability,
been employed. And if such a disease had previously
existed on the continent of Europe, there is every reason to believe
that it would have also existed and been known in Britain. Besides,
this reasoning certainly admits of being inverted and
changed, in so far that we may probably lay it down with equal
justice, that if the disease was new, as it would appear to have
been, in Scotland at that time, it was in all probability new also
to the other kingdoms of Europe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span></p>

<p class="tb"><i>2d Corollary.</i>&mdash;But if syphilis was thus new in Britain in the
end of the fifteenth century, this shows that it is a species of
disease distinct and different alike&mdash;1st, from gonorrh&oelig;a, and,
2d, from Greek leprosy, with both of which maladies it has, as is
now well known, been occasionally confounded; for both these
maladies existed, and were abundantly recognised, in this, as in
other countries, long before the era of the introduction of syphilis.
Gonorrh&oelig;a was early distinguished by English authors under the
name of &#8220;burning,&#8221; or &#8220;brenning&#8221; (<i>ardor urin&aelig;</i>, <i>arsura</i>, etc.)
Thus, Andrew Borde, in his &#8220;<i>Breviary of Health,</i>&#8221; 1546, speaks of
it as the &#8220;burning of an harlotte.&#8221; &#8220;Burning of harlottes&#8221; is
also mentioned in Bulleyn&#8217;s <i>Bulwark of Defence</i>, 1562. But it is
under this same name that reference is made to the same disease
in one of the ordinances enacted about 1430, for the better regulation
of the eighteen brothels that stood for centuries on the Bankside
in Southwark, under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Winchester.
At the above date it was decreed that &#8220;no stewholder
keep noo woman wythin his hous that hath any sickness of brenning.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a>
This statute was enacted half-a-century before the introduction
of syphilis in England; and nearly a century previously,
gonorrh&oelig;a had been accurately described, among others, by John
Arden, surgeon to Richard II., who, writing about 1380, gave a
correct summary of the symptoms, pathology, and treatment of
this malady. In an old English medical poem, evidently written
not later than the last part of the fourteenth century, and published
lately by Mr. Stephens of Copenhagen, there is a receipt for &#8220;all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>maner brenninge&#8221; (line 294); and then follows a series of cures
(line 510, etc.)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i6">&#8220;if ye verge be brente</div>
<div class="line">As man of woman may so be schente,</div>
<div class="line">Thorow cas y<sup>t</sup> wom&#257; may be his bote</div>
<div class="line">Off qwom his sekenesse be gan ye rote.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a></div>
</div></div></div>


<p>There is no doubt, further, that gonorrh&oelig;a was well known to
the Greek, Roman, and Arabic authors, and is described unmistakably
in their writings.</p>

<p>I might also, if it were here necessary, adduce abundant evidence
to show that the two diseases, Greek leprosy and syphilis,
though sometimes confounded together, were always in general
regarded as two entirely different affections; and that, as such, the
hospitals severally appointed for the reception of those unfortunates
labouring under the diseases in question were kept distinct
and separate. Thus, in 1527, the Carmelite monk, Paul Elia, proposed
to the burgomaster of Copenhagen a plan for an hospital
outside the town for &#8220;syphilis, cancer, and other great sores,&#8221;
similar to the Leper Hospital already existing;<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> for syphilis had,
at an early period of its existence, spread itself into Denmark.</p>

<p>When syphilis broke out in Edinburgh, in 1497, those affected
by it were not sent to the leper hospital then existing near the
town, but they were ordered off to Inchkeith. In the course of
the next century, we find in the Kirk Session books of Glasgow
the two maladies recognised as distinct, and two separate hospitals
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>devoted to those affected by these two separate diseases. For on
the 20th October 1586, the Kirk Session &#8220;ordains some to visit
the leper folks&#8217; house or spittal beyond the brig, to see how the
same, and the dykes of the yards may be reformed, and that nane
be received but town&#8217;s folks.&#8221; But again, in 1592, the same Session
directed &#8220;that the house beyond the stable-green-port for
women afflicted with the Glengore be looked after.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a></p>

<p>In a late census of Norway, above two thousand lepers were
found in that small kingdom; but the Scandinavian physicians do
not confound together syphilis and Greek elephantiasis, and have
no difficulty in distinguishing them. Nor have our own colonial
professional men in the East and in the West Indies, where both
diseases exist, any dubiety, at the present day, in recognising them
as two totally different and specific maladies.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>3d Corollary.</i>&mdash;As regards the mode or modes in which syphilis
was supposed to be so speedily propagated at its first appearance
in Europe, the Aberdeen and Edinburgh records are both interesting,
though in some respects they offer very opposite testimony on
this point.</p>

<p>For some time after syphilis broke out, it was believed, both
by medical men and by the non-medical public, that the disease
was communicable, and constantly communicated from the infected
to the healthy by the employment of the clothes, vessels,
baths, etc., used by those already suffering from it, and by the
slightest corporeal contact, or even by inhaling the same air with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>them. I might appeal on this head, if it were necessary, to the
individual and general testimony of Schilling, Torella, Brandt,
Massa, and almost every other early continental author, historical
or medical, who mentions the first outbreak of syphilis. Some
even thought that neither the presence of infected persons, nor of
fomites, was always absolutely requisite. In his work, <i>De Morbo
Gallico</i>, published in 1551 (above half-a-century after the disease
commenced), Benedict Victorius, of Fienga, like most of his contemporaries,
still maintained that &#8220;the state of the air&#8221; (to use his
own words), &#8220;together with that of the putrid humours, are sufficient
to beget the affection;&#8221; and in strong confirmation, he adds,
&#8220;I myself happened once to know some honest and religious nuns,
who were confined in the strictest manner, and yet contracted the
venereal disease from the peculiar state of the air, together with
that of the putrid humours, and the weakness of their habit of
body.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same belief in the easy contagion of syphilis without contact
or intercourse extended to our own country. It was, in particular,
strongly believed that the malady could be propagated from
the sick to the healthy by the medium of the breath. One of the
gravest articles of guilt brought against the celebrated Cardinal
Wolsey, when he was arraigned before the English House of Lords
in 1529, was the allegation that (to quote the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of the
indictment, as laid before Henry VIII.), &#8220;whereas your Grace is
our Sovereign Lord and Head, in whom standeth all the surety and
wealth of this realm, the same Lord Cardinal, knowing himself to
have the foul and contagious disease of the great pox, broken out
upon him in divers places of his body, came daily to your Grace,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
rowning in your ear, and blowing upon your most noble Grace with
his perilous and infective breath, to the marvellous danger of your
Highness, if God of his infinite goodness had not better provided
for your Highness. And when he was once healed of them, he
made your Grace believe that his disease was an impostume in his
head, and of none other thing.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a></p>

<p>The notion that the breath of persons having the venereal
disease was infectious seems to have prevailed as late as the reign
of William and Mary. Dr. Oates, in his <i>Picture of the late
King James</i> (1696), says,&mdash;&#8220;Tom Jones, your quondam chaplain,
was afraid to go to old Sheldon, for fear he should give him the
pox by breathing on him.&#8221; (Part II. p. 106.)</p>

<p>The Edinburgh regulations of September 1497 are evidently
framed upon the idea that &#8220;the contagious plage callit the grandgore,&#8221;
as they term it, was propagated by simple contact, and personal
intercourse, or probably even by the air. Hence their strict
injunctions for the removal and detention of the &#8220;infectit, or that
hes bene infectit and incurit,&#8221; to their secluded position upon the
island of Inchkeith, for &#8220;the eschewing&#8221; (to cite again the words
of the edict) &#8220;of the greit apperand danger of the infectioune of
the lieges.&#8221; Indeed, it seems to have been believed that the
disease might be communicated through medical attendants, or intermediate
individuals who were themselves unaffected. This is
at least the natural, or, indeed, the only interpretation of that part
of the edict which enjoined that all persons who take upon them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>&#8220;to hale the said contagious infirmitie,&#8221; go with their infected
patients to Inchkeith; and if they attended and treated such cases
within the city, they did so at the peril of being themselves
cauterised on the cheek with the &#8220;marking iron,&#8221; and banished
without favour (banisht but favouris) out of the town.</p>

<p>The anxiety of the authors of the Edinburgh regulations to
prevent this supposed medium of communication through a third
person is further displayed in the severity of the punishment&mdash;(the
application, namely, of the actual cautery to the face)&mdash;denounced
against the medical attendants who should infringe the
above edict by not passing to, and remaining on, Inchkeith.
&#8220;Lykwayis the saidis personis that takis the said cure of sanitie
vpoun thame, sal be byrnt on the cheike with the marking irne
that thai may be kennit in tyme to cum.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some time after the first outburst of the disease, sexual
intercourse with the infected does not seem to have been suspected
as the source and means by which the syphilitic contagion was
propagated. Nor was the local primary affection of the sexual
organs generally noticed by the authors of these times as either a
constant or marked symptom. They were acquainted with, and
described, only the secondary symptoms of the malady&mdash;the hideous
eruptions on the skin&mdash;the ulcers of the throat&mdash;the nocturnal
pains in, and lesions of, the bones&mdash;while they mostly all pass
over the genital organs, as if they remained unaffected. So much
so was this the case, that we find Montagnana, in 1498, advising
not as a means of infection, but rather as a means of cure, moderate
coition; for, in laying down various rules of treatment to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
sick bishop under his care for syphilis, he inculcates, among other
items &#8220;coitus vero sit temperatus.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a></p>

<p>When treating of this subject, and when speaking of both the
usual mode of the infection of syphilis and its primary local symptoms
generally escaping notice at the era of the first appearance of
the disease, Swediaur observes,&mdash;&#8220;It is worthy of remark, that
although many authors, since the year 1500, make mention of the
genital organs, and say that syphilis may more generally (ut
plurimum) be communicated by coition; not one before that time
(1500) points out the (primary) affection as essential or characteristic
of the disease. All (Swediaur adds) look upon it as a disease
pestilential and contagious without coition, and even without any
direct contact&#8221; (vol. i. p. 36). The observations of Astruc and
Girtanner, and other authors on this point, are nearly to the same
effect.</p>

<p>In relation to this question, that of the actual mode and means
of propagation of syphilis, the edict of Aberdeen, in 1497, is particularly
remarkable and interesting, and most fully maintains the
character of the capital of the north for that native shrewdness
and sagacity which the poet Dunbar long ago solemnly assigned to
it. We have just now referred to Swediaur, etc., stating that up
to 1500 all European writers looked upon syphilis as spreading,
pestilentially and contagiously, without coition. Three years
earlier, the aldermen and town-council of Aberdeen seem to
have arrived at more just ideas of its laws of propagation, and to
have distinctly suspected impure sexual intercourse as the mode
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>of communication of the malady. This seems to be fully borne
out by their ordering, &#8220;for the eschewing of the infirmitey,&#8221; that
(to use the words of the edict) &#8220;all licht weman be chargit and
ordanit to desist fra thar syne of venerie;&#8221; and we have the usual
glowing and earnest threat of the application of the actual cautery,
or &#8220;ane key of het yrne (hot iron) to thair chekis,&#8221; in case of disobedience.
The later Aberdeen edicts of 1507, which we have
already quoted at length, show, however, that the rulers of the
burgh had been subsequently led to adopt the erroneous idea of the
leading authorities of the day, that the disease might be transmitted
also in the way of common contagions, and even, perhaps,
by the medium of a third person.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>4th Corollary.</i>&mdash;The early notices that I have adduced of the
appearance of syphilis in Scotland are curious as proofs of the
rapidity with which the disease travelled, at its first outbreak, over
the kingdoms of Europe. The new malady was, as I have already
stated, first distinctly recognised during the period that Charles
VIII. of France occupied the city of Naples, or rather immediately
after he left that place. The cases of the disease that had appeared
previously were not, at least, anywhere in such numbers, or in such
severity, as to excite any marked and decided degree of attention
from physicians or from the public. That Naples was the locality
in which the contagion first burst forth so extensively and overtly
as to be considered almost the source and cradle of the new
epidemic; and further, that this happened at the precise date of
the visit of the French army, seems, as has been suggested by
various authors, to be shown by the very designations respectively
conferred at the time upon the new affection by the Neapolitans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
and French. For whilst, as already alluded to, the French, as is
well known, designated it at its first commencement among them
the Neapolitan disease, alleging it to have been communicated to
them by the inhabitants of Naples, the Neapolitans, on the other
hand, termed it the French disease, believing that it had been
brought to them by the victorious army of France. Now the date
of Charles&#8217;s sojourn in Naples is well known. His army, in their
march through Italy, arrived at Rome on the 4th December 1494,
and entered Naples on the 21st or 22d February 1495; and after
remaining three months, they vacated the city on the 20th May.
On the 24th of the same month the renowned Spanish general
Cordova landed in Sicily; on the 6th July the battle of Fuornovo
was fought, and next day King Ferdinand returned to Naples; but
the last remains of the French army did not reach France till the
end of the following year. The Aberdeen edict, however, was
issued within less than two years after Charles commenced his
march homeward. Or, we may state the matter otherwise. Columbus
arrived at Palos, in Andalusia, after his first voyage to the
New World, on the 15th March 1493, having previously landed at
Lisbon on the 6th, and visited the Portuguese King at Valparaiso:
while Pinzen, the commander of the other remaining caravel of
Columbus&#8217; tiny fleet, was, about the same date, driven northward
into the French port of Bayonne. Possibly one focus or centre for
the future spread and dissemination of syphilis was left in this
French port by Pinzen&#8217;s crew, if they brought the infection with
them; but I have nowhere found any allusion to this question.
Columbus reached Spain, from his second voyage, in April 1496.
The edict of the Aberdeen aldermen and council was passed on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
the 23d April 1497, or exactly four years and thirty-eight days
from the date of Columbus&#8217; first return to Spain; while the famous
ordinance of the Parisian authorities regarding syphilis was issued
on the 6th March 1497, only forty-eight days before that of Aberdeen.<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a></p>

<p>In reference to the rapidity with which syphilis spread from
the south and middle of Europe to this small and isolated kingdom
of Scotland, it is necessary to remember that in the last years of
the fifteenth century, and during the reign of James IV., the intercourse
of this country with &#8220;France, Spain, Portugal, Denmark,
and Flanders was (to quote the words of the Scottish historian,
Mr. Tytler) as regular and uninterrupted, not only in the more
solemn way of embassies, but by heralds, envoys, and merchants,
as that carried on with England.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a> There was in actual operation,
also, at that very date, another medium by which such a disease
was very likely to be carried from the Continent to our shores, and
diffused among the population of the larger towns. In November
1495, Perkin Warbeck, under the title of Prince Richard, Duke of
York, arrived in Scotland, and was received with regal honours by
King James, who bestowed upon him in marriage his cousin, the
Lady Catherine Gordon. This pretended claimant to the English
throne remained in Scotland till July 1497. He was preceded,
accompanied, and followed to this country by gay and reckless
&#8220;soldiers of fortune&#8221;from the Continent, Ireland, England, etc.&mdash;the
men of all others most likely to transmit and diffuse such a
disease as syphilis. These adventurers appear to have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>quartered by the Scottish King upon various towns. Thus, the
town-records of Aberdeen show that, as early as the 5th July 1495,&mdash;some
months before Warbeck himself arrived in Scotland,&mdash;a
burgh tax was imposed &#8220;to the sustentacioun of aught Inglismen
of the Duk of Yorkis, direkit to the toune by our souerane lordis
hiennes, and his letteris therapone.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Spalding Club Extracts</i>,
vol. i. p. 57.)</p>

<p>The speed, however, with which the disease thus travelled from
the south of Europe to its western confines has been often employed
as an argument to show that the contagion of syphilis was
propagated at its first introduction by laws different from those
which now regulate its communication. In other words, it has
been often alleged that the disease was then spread from kingdom
to kingdom, and from city to city, by epidemic influences and by
general contagion, and not merely by the slower medium of impure
sexual connection. We have just seen such a doctrine so far
belied by the sagacious regulations of the magistrates of Aberdeen;
and when we look to the then existing state of Society, both on
the Continent and in our own country, to the loose manners and
licentious lives of these times, we shall probably find a sufficient
solution of the, at first sight, difficult problem of the rapid dissemination
of the new malady. The morals of the general mass of
the people are ever found to be principally regulated by the example
set before them by the aristocracy and clergy. At the date
of the introduction of syphilis into Europe, the notorious habits of
the two latter ruling bodies were assuredly such as to expedite
greatly the diffusion of the new scourge that had sprung up among
them; and hence, at its first outbreak, we find the disease fixing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
itself upon several of the highest members of the continental
courts, and of the church. The Emperor Charles V., and Pope
Alexander VI., kings and cardinals, princes and bishops, peers
and priests, are openly and publicly recorded among its victims by
those who personally watched and described the first ravages of
syphilis. In fact the disease was then scarcely, or indeed not at
all, looked upon as conferring any degree of infamy.</p>

<p>In his tract on the malady,<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> published at Rome in the year
1500, Peter Pinctor mentions by name, and without any reticence,
three of the more illustrious patients whom he had treated for this
new disease&mdash;namely, the Prebendary Centez, the Cardinal of
Segovia, and his Holiness the reigning Pope. Writers thought it
no imputation on their own characters to publish an account of
the disease as it occurred in their own persons. The physician
Joseph Grunbeck of Burkchausen, in his essay &#8220;De Pestilentiali
Scorra sive Mala de Frantzos&#8221; (1496), tells his readers how he
himself caught the disease from the atmosphere, when walking in
some fields near Augsburg. One of the earliest adherents and
fiercest champions of the Reformation in Germany was Ulric
H&uuml;tten, &#8220;the poet and valiant knight of the sixteenth century,&#8221;
as Merle D&#8217;Aubign&eacute; designates him. In 1519, H&uuml;tten, though
bred to arms, and not to physic, published a treatise&mdash;<i>De Guiaci
Medicina, etc., Morbo Gallico</i>. In this treatise he details his own
case and sufferings from the disease, how he had been &#8220;utterly
vexed with the sycknes,&#8221;&mdash;had been eleven times salivated for it,
and was at last cured by guiacum. This treatise, written, as the
preface bears, by &#8220;that great clerke of Almayne, Ulrich H&uuml;tten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>,
Knycht,&#8221; was translated by Thomas Paynell, Chanon of Marten
Abbey, and published in England in 1539. The disease was, in
H&uuml;tten&#8217;s opinion, produced &#8220;throughe some unholsome blastes of
the ayre.&#8221; His polemical antagonist, Erasmus, in his <i>Colloquy of
Gamos and Agamos</i>, denounced fiercely the character of this reforming
and literary knight:&mdash;&#8220;Qualis eques (he exclaims) cui per
Scabiem vix in sella sedere liceat!&#8221;</p>

<p>In order to show how swiftly a disease, propagated in the way
syphilis is, might overrun the society of continental Europe
towards the conclusion of the fifteenth century, it is only necessary
to allude to the dire and deplorable state of morals among
those that ought to have set an example to the community&mdash;namely,
the clergy of these days, as painted by the tongue and
pens of their own writers. In an official sermon published by
Martene (tom. ii. p. 1758), and preached in St.&nbsp;Peter&#8217;s at Rome by
the Apostolic Auditor prior to the election of the Pope in the year
1484, the corrupt morals and dishonesty of the whole church are
denounced; and it is added that many do not merely commit, but
triumph even in, such sins as the subversion of chastity and other
virtues (de pudicitia, c&aelig;terisque virtutibus subversis, triumphantes).
The frightful licentiousness and obscene orgies of the reigning
pontiff, and of his family and court, which speedily followed, formed
a hideous practical commentary upon this text. A high Romanist
who had the honour of refusing a cardinal&#8217;s hat, Claud D&#8217;Espence,
Rector of the University of Paris, after exposing the infamy of the
taxes of the apostolic chancery, with its list of &#8220;filthy and horrid
iniquities&#8221; (f&oelig;dorum tamque horrendorum scelerum)&mdash;a license
for any and all of which could be purchased&mdash;adds, &#8220;You shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
say we ingenuously confess that God permits this (Lutheran) prosecution
to come upon his church on account of the sins of men,
chiefly of priests and prelates, from whose sins the Scriptures cry
out that the sins of the people are derived.... Is it wonderful
if the malady descend from the head to the members, from the
supreme Pontiff to others?<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> Where under heaven is there a
greater license of all evils (infamia, impudecentia, etc.)?...
Truly (adds D&#8217;Espence, and he had personally visited Rome), evils
such and so great that no one can believe but he who has seen,
and no one can deny but he who has not seen....</p>

<p>Previously another orthodox Roman ecclesiastic, Nicolas de Clemangis,
Archdeacon of Bayeaux, had, in indignant, and, let us
hope, in too sweeping terms, denounced the continental nunneries
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
of these dark days as little better than brothels, and the taking of
the veil as almost synonymous with a profession of public prostitution:&mdash;&#8220;Nam

there was, as Cardinal Bellarmine confesses and laments, &#8220;almost

<p>As far as regarded the predisposing habits and influence of the
clergy, matters were not better in Britain than on the Continent,
when the disease first reached this country. We have already
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>seen Cardinal Wolsey, the primate of England, publicly accused in
Parliament of labouring under the disease. We can, however,
wonder the less at the disease attacking such a high dignitary,
when we recollect that, according to some writers,<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> there was
openly inscribed over the doors of a palace belonging to this prelate&mdash;&#8220;<i>Domus
Meretricium Domini Cardinalis</i>.&#8221; Polydore Vergil,
the sub-collector of the Pope&#8217;s revenues in England, speaks, perhaps
in exaggerated terms, of the orgies in the residence of Wolsey, by
which he allured at first the young King Henry VIII. &#8220;Domi
suae voluptatum omnium sacrarium fecit quo regem frequenter
ducebat. Sermones leporis plenos habebat, etc.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> The manners
of the inferior dignitaries of the church offered only too close an
imitation of those of its primate. The commissioners appointed
by Henry VIII. to visit the monasteries of England have recorded
a sad, and (even setting aside the influence of prejudice) probably
only too true a picture of the moral degeneracy of the great mass
of the regular clergy of the time. With some few cheering and
honourable exceptions, they found the occupants of most of the
monasteries following lives of degraded vice and licentiousness, instead
of religious purity and exemplary rectitude. When the visitors
received their commissions and instructions, they were despatched
into different parts of the kingdom, at the same time, that the
monks might have as little warning of their approach as possible.
They executed, says the historian Henry,<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> their commissions with
zeal and diligence, and made some curious discoveries almost in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>every house, not much to the honour of its inhabitants. Accounts,
he adds, of their proceedings were transmitted by the visitor to the
vicar-general, and they contained sufficient materials to render the
monasteries completely infamous,&mdash;for their gross, absurd superstition,
their shameful impositions, their abandoned unnatural incontinency,
etc. etc. Some of the old abbots and friars did not attempt
to conceal their amours, because they knew it was impossible.
The holy father, the prior of Maiden Bradley, assured the visitors
that he had only married six of his sons and one of his daughters
out of the goods of the priory as yet; but that several more of his
children were now growing or grown up, and would soon be marriageable.
He produced a dispensation from the Pope, permitting
him to keep a mistress; and he asseverated that he took none but
young maidens to be his mistresses, the handsomest that he could
procure; and when he was disposed to change, he got them individually
provided with very good lay husbands.<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a> &#8220;These be the
men&#8221; (exclaimed Simon Fish, in one of his celebrated public
sermons which he delivered at the period we speak of), &#8220;these be
the men that corrupt the whole generation in your realm, that
catch the pox of one woman, and bear it to another; that be
burnt with one woman, and bear it to another.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a></p>

<p>Clerical morals and manners were not in a much healthier
state on the Scottish side of the Border. Towards the end of the
fifteenth century, we have not on record any such obscene scandal
as was detailed in a previous century in the <i>Chronicle of Lanercost</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>regarding Priest John, who is alleged to have publicly celebrated
phallic orgies among the young inhabitants of his parish of Inverkeithing,<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a>
a town which was certainly a place of no small note and
importance in these early days. But clerical morals were still
confessedly in a sad state about the time that syphilis first appeared
in this part of the island. The <i>General Satyre</i> of Scotland, written,
as I have already stated, at the commencement of the sixteenth
century, stigmatises amongst other things&mdash;</p>

<p>Queen Mary would seem to have regarded the health of the
high Roman church dignitary who baptized her son James VI.
with considerable suspicion, perhaps, however, only in as much as
he was one of a class with a very bad character in that respect.
King James, in &#8220;A Premonition to all most mightie Monarchs,
Kings, Free Princes, and States of Christendome,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a> thus refers to it:&mdash;&#8220;For
first, I am no apostate, as the Cardinal (Bellarmine) would
make me, not onely having ever been brought up in that religion
which I presently professe, but even my father and grandfather on
that side professing the same: and so cannot be properly an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>Heratike, by there own doctrine, since I never was of their
church; and as for the Queene my mother of worthy memorie,
although she continued in that religion wherein she was nourished,
yet she was so farre from being superstitious or Jesuited therein,
that at my Baptisme (although I was baptized by a Popish Archbishop)
she sent him word to forbeare to use the spettle in my
baptisme; which was obeyed, being indeed a filthy, and an apish
trick, rather in scorne than in imitation of Christ; and her owne
very words were, that &#8216;She would not have a pokie priest to spet
in her child&#8217;s mouth.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Of the dissolute lives of the Scotch, like the other clergy of
these times, we may find ample proof in some of the contemporaneous
medical works. We know, for example, from an old
medical author, something of the inner life of the identical &#8220;pockie
priest&#8221; who baptized James VI. In 1552, Dr. Jerome Cardan, the
famous Italian physician, came from Milan to Edinburgh to visit
professionally the high ecclesiastic in question&mdash;namely, John
Hamilton, Archbishop of St.&nbsp;Andrews&mdash;who was suffering under
severe and recurrent attacks of asthma. He travelled with all
possible expedition, and in these &#8220;good olden times&#8221; the part of
his journey from London to Edinburgh only took twenty-three
days. Cardan has left us in his works a copy of the lengthy and
very minute medical and hygienic directions which he drew up for
the behoof of the archbishop. Besides giving him innumerable
medical prescriptions, he lays down for him excellent rules regarding
his food, drink, exercise, sleep, etc., down to the materials of
which his bed and his pillows should be composed. He adds for
the Archbishop&#8217;s guidance the following rule&mdash;&#8220;De Venere. Certe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
non est bona, neque utilis: ubi tamen contingat necessitas, debet
uti ea inter duos somnos, secilicet post mediam noctem, et melius
est exercere eam ter in sex diebus pro exemplo, ita ut singulis
duobus diebus semel, quam bis in una die, etiam quod staret per
decem dies.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a></p>

<p>The quiet and matter-of-course style in which these rules are
laid down and published proves only too strongly the dissolute life
of some of the highest clergy in our land; and in order to appreciate
the full force of this observation, it is necessary to remember
that Cardan&#8217;s patient was the living head of the Scottish Roman
Catholic church of that day&mdash;the Primate and Metropolitan of
Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a> Perhaps still more unequivocal evidence of the scandalous
profligacy of the Scottish clergy of these times is to be found
in their own statutes, and in the legal documents of the country.</p>

<p>In a provincial council of the Scottish clergy, held at Edinburgh
in 1549, the circumstance that there had come very grave scandals
to the church from the incontinence of ecclesiastics (ex clericorum
incontinentia, gravissima ecclesi&aelig; scandala esse exorta) was taken
into consideration, and the edict of the Council of Basle &#8220;De Concubinariis&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
put in force. Another edict was passed by this Edinburgh
synod &#8220;exhorting&#8221; both the prelates and inferior clergy not
to keep their own illegitimate children in their company, prohibiting
their promotion of them in their churches, and forbidding the
endowment of them with baronies out of the church&#8217;s goods.<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a> But
perhaps the dissolute and depraved state of the Romish church in
Scotland is more clearly photographed in a subsequent edict, which
they passed in a large synod held at Edinburgh in 1558-9. This
edict does not &#8220;exhort&#8221; against incontinence on the part of the
priests, but it simply and shamelessly restricts, and lays down a
legal limit to, the amount of property which they might unsacrilegiously
abstract and purloin from the pious endowments belonging
to the Church (de patrimonio Christi) for the marriage portions
of the bastard daughters of their concubines; the synod enacting
that neither prelates nor any other ecclesiastics should directly or
indirectly give with their illegitimate daughters, in marriage to
barons or other landowners, any greater sum than one hundred
pounds yearly of the Church&#8217;s patrimony.<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a></p>

<p>The legitimation of bastard children was necessary before they
could inherit or dispose of property, and exercise other legal rights.
The Privy Seal Records of Scotland for the earlier years of the
sixteenth century have been preserved, and are full of entries of
legitimation of the bastard children of Scottish prelates and priests.
Lord Hailes gives us some sad information regarding the numbers
of the illegitimate children of the Scottish bishops, abbots, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>monks of these times.<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a> Among others, he states that David
Bethune, the immediate predecessor of Hamilton in the archbishopric
of St.&nbsp;Andrews and primacy of Scotland, had three
bastards legitimised in one day; and afterwards, Patrick Hepburn,
Bishop of Moray, had seven&mdash;five sons and two daughters&mdash;all
acknowledged in one day. John Leslie, Bishop of Ross, himself
the illegitimate son of an official in the diocese of Moray&mdash;viz.
of Gavin Leslie, parson of Kingusie, was the father of several
illegitimate children; and it is, says the learned author of the
<i>Book of Bon Accord</i>, sufficiently amusing to find his name among
those of the other members of the chapter of Aberdeen who
solemnly counselled their ordinary to &#8220;caus the lay kirkmen within
their diocie to reforme thameselfes in all thair slanderous maner
of lyving, and to remove thair <i>oppin</i> concubins.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a></p>

<p>Concubinage among the lower clergy, provided it was not
slanderously open and avowed, would almost seem to have been
overlooked and connived at by the church dignitaries of those
degenerate times.<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a></p>

<p>The remains of the old chapel of St.&nbsp;Ninian, at Leith, still exist
in the vicinity of Edinburgh. The spire of the church is, even at
the present day, a conspicuous object above the second harbour
bridge, though the chapel itself and its prebendary are degraded to
common dwellings. This chapel was founded by Robert Bellenden,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>Abbot of Holyrood, and endowed for two chaplains. In the charter
of foundation, which is dated 1493 (four years before syphilis
broke out in Edinburgh), it is&mdash;in accordance with a common
formula in these deeds&mdash;ordained that if &#8220;either of the aforesaid
chaplains keep a lass or concubine, in an open and notorious
manner, he shall be degraded; which seems,&#8221; as the historian
Maitland pertly observes, &#8220;to imply this, that they or either of
them might keep a miss or misses provided it were not publickly
known.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a></p>

<p>Nor was poverty on the part of a portion of the priesthood
apparently any great obstacle to such, as well as to less sinful
indulgences. For, according to the testimony of honest George
Marjoribanks (see his <i>Annals of Scotland</i>, p. 5), &#8220;In the yeir of
God 1533 Sir Walter Cowpur, Chaiplaine in Edinburgh, gate a
pynte of vyne, a laiffe of 36 unce vaight, a pock of aite-meill, a
pynte of aill, a schiepe-hede, ane penny candell, and a faire woman
for ane xviii<sup>d</sup> grote.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very shortly before the commencement of syphilis, the dissolute
manners of the English clergy, especially of the regulars,
created such noise and commotion among the laity, that Pope
Innocent VIII. sent in 1490 (a few years before the actual appearance
of the disease) to Archbishop Merton, authorising him to admonish
his abbots and priors that &#8220;by their lewd and dissolute
lives they brought ruin upon their own souls, and set a bad
example to others.&#8221; In obedience to this bull, the Primate sent
monitory letters to the superiors of all convents and religious
houses in his province, admonishing and commanding them, by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>the authority he had received from the Pope, to reform themselves
and their subjects from certain vices, of which they were said to
be guilty. The monitory letter that was sent on this occasion to
the Abbot of St.&nbsp;Alban&#8217;s is published in Wilkins&#8217;s <i>Concilia</i>, vol. iii.
p. 632. If that Abbot and his monks were stained with all the
odious vices of which the Primate openly accuses them in this
letter, they stood much in need of reformation. Some of these
vices, says Dr. Henry, were so detestable that they cannot so much
as be named in history. &#8220;You are infamous,&#8221; writes the Archbishop
to the Abbot, for &#8220;simony, usury, and squandering away
the possessions of your monastery, besides other enormous crimes.&#8221;
One of these crimes was, that the Abbot had turned all the modest
women out of the two nunneries of Pray and Sapwell (over which
he pretended to have a jurisdiction), and filled them with prostitutes;
that these nunneries were esteemed no better than brothels,
and that he and his monks publicly frequented them as such.
His Grace seems to have been well and accurately informed, for he
even names some of these infamous women and their gallants.
The monks, too, were at least as profligate as their Abbot, for they
also kept their concubines both within and without the monastery.</p>

<p>When such was the scandalous life led by some of the clergy,
we cannot wonder that, before the introduction of syphilis, Rabelais
(himself at one time a monk) should apply to the gonorrh&oelig;al disease
the very significant term of &#8220;rhume ecclesiastique;&#8221; or that,
after the appearance of syphilis, this latter and greater malady
should have spread speedily among all ranks, down from the clergy
to the laity, and from the king to the churl, and should have
become diffused by such stealthy but rapid steps over the countries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
of Europe, as to have at first been mistaken for a malady spreading
itself, not by impure intercourse, but by general epidemic influences.
And when we advert to the existing state of society in that age,
and couple it with such notices as we have found in the Aberdeen
records, we may surely (in despite of all that has been written to
the contrary, both in ancient and modern times) reasonably doubt
whether the laws regulating the propagation of syphilis in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were in any degree different from
what we know them to be in the nineteenth century. The Aberdeen
edict shows that three hundred and sixty odd years ago, or in
1497, the common mode of infection of the disease was precisely
the same as all acknowledge it to be at the present day.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51" id="Footnote_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51"><span class="label">51</span></a> In the index to Tanner&#8217;s <i>Notitia Monastica</i> (Nasmith&#8217;s folio edition),
509 hospitals, leper-houses, and Maisons dieu are referred to as having existed
in England previously to the Act for their suppression by Henry VIII. (See a
table in Taylor&#8217;s <i>Index Monasticus</i>, p. xxv.) We have no collection of data
on which to form any similar general calculation for Scotland. In Chalmers
<i>Caledonia</i> (vol. ii. p. 347) nine hospitals are stated to have existed in the
county of Berwick alone. In the Scottish Parliament of 1424, an Act was
passed regarding the hospitals &#8220;uphaldane to pure folks and seik&#8221; (poor
people and sick) throughout the kingdom, and empowering the chancellor and
bishops to &#8220;reduce and reforme tham to the effec of thair first fundacione&#8221;
(see Thomson&#8217;s edition of the <i>Scotch Acts of Parliament</i>, vol. ii. p. 7). Some
of the hospitals in these early times were founded for the reception of the
sick and infirm, others for lepers, many for the poor and aged, and a considerable
number for the gratuitous entertainment of pilgrims and travellers.
Among the whole long English list I have only found four endowed as lunatic
asylums. A few were instituted for purposes which sound strangely in the
ears of the present generation. Thus the hospital of Flixton, or Carman&#8217;s
Spittle, in the parish of Folketon, Yorkshire, was founded in the time of King
Athelstane, to preserve travellers from being devoured by the wolves and
other voracious and forest beasts of the districts (&#8220;pro conservatione populi
inde transeuntis, ne populus ille per lupos et alias bestias voraces et sylvestres,
inibi existentes, devoretur&#8221;). See the renewed charter of Henry VI. in the
<i>Monasticon Anglicanum</i>, tom. ii. p. 372.</p></div>

the same terms, more or less slightly changed. In his Travels in Africa,
Egypt, and Syria (p. 332), Browne speaks of elephantiasis under the local
designation of <i>dzudham</i>; Niebuhr says it is still named in Arabia and Persia
<i>dsjuddam</i> and <i>Madsjuddam</i>. (Pinkerton&#8217;s <i>Collection of Voyages and Travels</i>,
vol. x. p. 170.) In Morocco it is called at the present day <i>Jeddem</i> and <i>Murd

made from the Arabic. It is proper, however, to add, that the translator of
the works of Haly Abbas has so far avoided the error alluded to, by translating
the Juzam of his author by elephanta. With this single exception,
the error might otherwise, I believe, be called universal.</p></div>

Greek elephantiasis is still adhered to by some modern authors. Thus Plenck,
in his celebrated <i>Nosology of Cutaneous Diseases</i>, denominates (after the
example of the translators from the Arabic) the Barbadoes leg &#8220;Elephantiasis,&#8221;
and applies to the Greek elephantiasis the simple term &#8220;Lepra.&#8221;
Hence he defines lepra to be &#8220;that disease in which the skin, particularly of
the face, becomes rugose and irregular (<i>aspera</i>), and is deformed with large
reddish-livid and chinked tubercles (<i>rimosis tuberibus</i>), along with insensibility
of the extremities, and the voice raucous and nasal.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Doctrina de Morbis

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_173" id="Footnote_173"></a><a href="#FNanchor_173"><span class="label">173</span></a> Several of the authors quoted above, divide the <i>species</i> Lepra into four
modifications or varieties: the Lepra Leonina, Lepra Elephantia, Lepra
Alopecia, and Lepra Tyria. This division, which some of them freely allow to
be founded more in theory than in nature, seems to have been first proposed
by Constantinus Africanus. (<i>De Morborum Cognitione</i>, chap. 17.) Like the
fanciful fourfold subdivision of other diseases, it was made in correspondence
with the Hippocratic and Galenic doctrine of the four humours. Theodoric,
Arnald, Gilbert, and the other authors who, in accordance with the pathological
creeds of the time, were led to adopt it, attribute each particular variety
to the operation and predominance of a particular humour. John of Gaddesden
has attempted, in his <i>Rosa Anglica</i>, to dress up different medical doctrines
in rude Latin hexameters, and amongst others, he announces the doctrine in
question in the five following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_199" id="Footnote_199"></a><a href="#FNanchor_199"><span class="label">199</span></a> This complication was not so common as to be regarded as a constant
and pathognomonic sign of Greek elephantiasis, but it is noted as an important
and frequent one, by various authors, both ancient and modern. Hally-Abbas
tells us, in our diagnosis of a case of the disease, to be particular in examining
&#8220;album oculorum ne forte turbatum est&#8221; (Lib. i. cap. xxiv.); Rhazes attributes
great value as a diagnostic mark of his Juddam or elephantiasis to the &#8220;conturbatio
albedinis oculorum&#8221; (Lib. v. cap. cxx.); Avicenna, among his incipient
signs, states &#8220;et apparet in oculis obfuscatio ad rubedinem declivis&#8221; (Lib. iv.
Fen. iii. Fr. 3, cap. ii.) Not to multiply examples, I may merely mention
that Theodoric, in the thirteenth century, places early among his list of signs
&#8220;oculorum in albedine lividitas&#8221; (Lib. iii. cap. lv.); see also Lanfranc (Doct.
i. Tr. iii. c. 7, albedo oculorum obfuscator); Arnald of Villeneuve (Brev. ii. c.
46, multum rubeae); Gilbert (Lib. viii. oculi circulos habent rubros), etc. Dr.
Heberden, in his account of the tubercular leprosy in Madeira, states, in regard
to a case, &#8220;that the confirmed elephantiasis was attended with <i>livid</i> and
scirrhous tubercles, which had overspread the face and limbs; the whole body
was emaciated; the eyebrows inflated; the hair of the eyebrows fallen off
entirely; the bones of the nose depressed; the <i>alae nasi</i> tumefied, as likewise
the lobes of the ears; <i>with a suffusion in both eyes</i>, which had almost deprived
the patient of sight,&#8221; etc.&mdash;<i>Medical Transactions of the College of Physicians</i>,
vol. i. p. 35.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_200" id="Footnote_200"></a><a href="#FNanchor_200"><span class="label">200</span></a> I give the term &#8220;livid&#8221; as synonymous with the old Scotch term &#8220;haw,&#8221;
under the idea that it expresses in all probability, as nearly as possible, the
meaning of the author. The Scottish writer Gawin Douglas renders the Latin
adjectives &#8220;caeruleus&#8221; and &#8220;glaucus,&#8221; by the adjective &#8220;haw,&#8221; in his celebrated
translation of &#8220;The xiii. bukes of Eneados of the famose poet, Virgill,
out of Latyne verses, into Scottish meter.&#8221; For the occasional livid colour
of the lumps or tubercles in the face, see the extract in the preceding note
from Dr. Heberden, and the modern descriptions quoted in a previous page
from Bateman and Schedel.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_201" id="Footnote_201"></a><a href="#FNanchor_201"><span class="label">201</span></a> Since writing the above, I have met with the following interesting
notice in the still earlier voyage of Martin to St.&nbsp;Kilda, the most westerly
island of the Hebrides. Describing his visit to St.&nbsp;Kilda, in 1697, he states,
&#8220;Some thirteen years ago, the Leprosy broke amongst the inhabitants, and
some of their numbers died of it. There are two families at present labouring
under the disease. The symptoms of it are, their feet begin to fail; their
appetite declining; their faces becoming too red, and breaking out in pimples;
a hoarseness, and their hair falling off from their heads; the crown (?) of it
exulcerates and blisters; and, lastly, their beards grow thinner than ordinary.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Voyage
to St.&nbsp;Kilda</i> (first published in 1698), p. 40 of edition of 1749.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_203" id="Footnote_203"></a><a href="#FNanchor_203"><span class="label">203</span></a> &#8220;The Moderator proposed to the session, that, considering that a
Gracious Providence had not only delivered the Island and country from the
burden and necessity of maintaining and otherwise providing for the poor
Lepers, formerly in this Island, but had also put a stop to the spreading of
that unclean and infectious disease, so that there is no appearance of the
symptoms thereof in any person now in this place, the Session should therefore
ordain a day to be set apart for solemn thanksgiving for so great a
deliverance throughout this ministry excepting Fowla, which we can have no
access to probably to inform. The Session having heard the Moderator&#8217;s
proposal, were cordially satisfied therewith, and did agree unanimously that
a day be set apart for solemn thanksgiving on the above account throughout
the bounds of the ministry, excepting Fowla, as above said.&#8221; (Extracts from
the MS. Session Register of Walls, under date of 17th March 1742.) The
19th May 1742 was held as the day of thanksgiving, as appears from a subsequent
entry.</p></div>

Henry, had been, to all appearance, for a considerable time past, deeply
tinted with the inveterate scurvy, commonly called the Leprosy in this place,

Froissart states, &#8220;And thus, soone after thys noble Robert de Brouse, Kyng
of Scotland, trespassed out of thys incertayne worlde, and his hart was taken
owte of his body and embawmed, and honourably he was entred in the Abbey
of Donfremlyne.&#8221; When the grave of the Bruce was opened at Dunfermline
in 1818, the anatomical appearances of the skeleton showed that the king&#8217;s
will had been so far obeyed, the bones of the chest being found divided in
such a way as to have allowed the removal of the heart. This piece of dissection
seems, at the time at which it was made, to have drawn down the
dreaded vengeance of the Vatican upon Randolph, Earl of Moray, the king&#8217;s
nephew, and apparently the operator in this case, in such a way as forms a
strange and startling contrast with the medical usages observed towards the
dead at the present day. I quote the account, as a curious point in the march
of necroscopic anatomy, from the Appendix to the <i>Chronicon de Lanercost</i> (p.
428)&mdash;&#8220;It appears that, by a constitution of Pope Boniface, the mutilation
of a dead body subjected those by whom it was mutilated to heavy ecclesiastical
censures. To free himself from these censures, Randolph, two years
after the death of King Robert, presented a petition to the Pope, setting forth
that the deceased king had intended to undertake a crusade against the
Saracens, but was prevented by death, and that in his last will he expressly
ordered his heart to be taken out of his body and carried in such an expedition,
which was done by James de Douglas, who conveyed it into Spain. The
Bishop of Moray was employed to obtain from the Pope a remission for the
crime, dated 8th before the Ides of August, in the fifteenth year of Pope
John&#8217;s pontificate.&#8221; Raynald, in his <i>Annal. Ecclest.</i>, gives the extract <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>

lists of articles of food as capable of producing leprosy&mdash;some accusing
too great quantities of animal diet&mdash;others blaming too much vegetable diet
as the cause, while a third class, as Theodoric, impugn too free a use of
either or both (nimium usum carnis vaccinae, buballinae, lentium et omnium
leguminum. Theodoric, c. 55). Some authors state the most strange doctrines
on this point. Thus Bernhard Gordon gravely states, that to partake of fish
and milk in the same meal does induce leprosy (comedere lac et pisces in
eadam mensa inducit Lepram. <i>Lilium Medicinae</i>, p. 48). The same idea is
repeated from Avicenna down to our countryman Gilbert, and it is probably
not unworthy of being remarked that the same prejudice in regard to the
influence of a mixed fish and milk diet prevails, or prevailed till of late, in
such opposite points as Madeira and Hindostan.&mdash;(Heberden&#8217;s paper on

a leper, came before the twelve governors of the town of Beverley in the
Guildhall, and prayed license to have one bed (et petiit licenceam here [habere]
unum lectum) in the leper-house without Keldgate bar, which said twelve
governors, viz. Nicelas Ryse, William Pollesta, etc., by their common consent

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_371" id="Footnote_371"></a><a href="#FNanchor_371"><span class="label">371</span></a> The whole chapter of Vegetius &#8220;Quemadmodum sanitas gubernetur
exercitus,&#8221; etc., is so interesting that I will take the liberty of here quoting
it in full:&mdash;&#8220;Now (what is to be most specially attended to), I will give
directions how the health of an army is to be preserved, in as far as regards
places for encampment, waters, temperature, medicine, and exercise. With
respect to places, the soldiers should not remain long near unhealthy marshes,
nor in arid situations that are destitute of the shades of trees; nor on hills
without tents in summer. They ought not to be late in the day in commencing
their march, lest they contract disease from the heat of the sun and
the fatigue of their journey; and, indeed, in summer, they had better arrive
at their destination before the morning is advanced. In severe weather they
should not pursue their journey through snow and ice at night; nor be
allowed to suffer from scarcity of fuel, or a deficient supply of clothing. For
the soldier who is obliged to endure cold is neither in a fit state for enjoying
health, nor for marching. Nor should he make use of unwholesome nor of
marsh waters. For a draught of bad water induces, like a poison, disease in
those who drink it. And, moreover, in this case, the unremitting diligence
of the generals, tribunes, and their assistants, as wielding the highest authority,
will be required, so that their sick comrades may be restored by seasonable
articles of food, and be cured by the skill of the physicians (<i>arte medicorum</i>).
For it is difficult to manage with those who are at one and the same time
oppressed with the evils of disease and of war. But those who are skilled in
military affairs have held that daily exercise contributes more to the health
of the soldiers than the physicians do. Wherefore, they have advised that
the foot soldiers should be regularly exercised during seasons of rain and snow
under cover, and at other seasons openly. In like manner, they have ordered
that the horsemen should assiduously exercise themselves and their horses,
not only on level ground, but also in steep places, and in parts rendered
difficult by wide ditches, so that nothing new or strange may occur to them
in this respect during the casualties of battle. From all this may be inferred
how much the more diligently an army ought to be trained in the exercise
of arms, seeing, as we do, that the habit of labour procures alike health in the
camp and victory in the battle-field. If (Vegetius adds) a multitude of
soldiers be permitted during the summer or autumn seasons to remain long
in the same locality, from the corruption of the water, and the stench of their
filth, the atmosphere is rendered insalubrious, their respiration becomes
vitiated, and most dangerous disease is engendered; and this cannot be
remedied by any other means than by a change of encampment.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>De Re

that in practice Machaon exercised only the art of surgery, while Podalirius
followed the art of medicine. Hence, it is argued, Agamemnon, when Menelaus

of the early cyclic poets, takes this view.&mdash;See Welcker&#8217;s <i>Cyclus Epicus</i>: &#8220;Ilii

some commentators to indicate that eight soldiers, perhaps previously experienced
to some extent in tending the wounded, were selected and improvised
into medical officers, rather than that eight were chosen out of a greater
number of medical attendants present with the army. But, in all probability,
there were present among the ten thousand Greeks more than eight men who
professed the imperfect medical knowledge pertaining to the surgeons of that
day. In a later part of the <i>Anabasis</i> (v. 8), Xenophon, in defending himself
against accusations of alleged severity on his part, in the course of the retreat,
to some of the soldiers under his command, argues for its necessity on the
principle that &#8220;physicians also use incisions and caustics for the good of their
patients.&#8221; He owns to having urged some, when themselves unwilling, to
continue their march towards the shores of the Black Sea, through the cold
and snows of Armenia, &#8220;because,&#8221; says he, &#8220;sitting down and rest made the
blood to congeal, and the toes to rot off, which was the case of a great many,&#8221;&mdash;a
result that lately happened only too frequently to the soldiers of our own
armies on the opposite or Crimean shores of the Euxine.</p></div>

an account is given of the extraction of an arrow from the king&#8217;s shoulder, by
the surgeon Philip of Acarnania, who had previously cured Alexander of the
attack of fever which followed on his bathing, when overheated, in the cold
waters of the Cydnus. Curtius speaks (iii. 13) of Philip as one &#8220;inter nobiles
medicos,&#8221; who were present with the army. When describing the well-known
incident of the fever draught given by this physician Philip to Alexander,
Arrian speaks of him, not as a medical attendant upon the king, but as one
&#8220;in whose extraordinary skill in physic Alexander had great confidence,
because of his success in the camp,&#8221; or in attending upon other members of
the army.&mdash;(Lib. ii. cap. 4.) Alexander himself affected some knowledge of
medicine. At least, when Craterus was invalided, and Pausanias, the physician
in attendance upon him, proposed to give him a dose of hellebore, Alexander
(as we are informed by Plutarch) wrote a letter to Pausanias, expressing his
great anxiety about the case, and desiring him to be cautious in the use of
this medicine. In Alexander&#8217;s own chest-wound, as detailed in the text
above, the head of the arrow possibly did not enter the cavity of the thorax,
as its point was, according to Plutarch&#8217;s account, fixed in the bone (the scapula
or a rib?). When Julius C&aelig;sar fell under the daggers of his assassins, out
of the twenty-three wounds which he received, there was none that was mortal,
in the opinion of the surgeon Antistisius, except the second, a penetrating
wound of the breast. (See Suetonius&#8217; <i>Julius</i>, c. 82.) After Epaminondas was
fatally wounded at the battle of Mantinea, he refused to allow the iron of the
spear with which he was struck to be extracted till the victory was decided&mdash;aware
that, from its site, death from bleeding would immediately follow&mdash;an
event which the result confirmed.&mdash;(<i>Cornel. Nepos</i>, lib. xv. c. 9.)</p></div>

slew Mamilius, he was himself struck with a javelin while stripping the body
of his enemy; and on being brought back to the camp victorious, he died on
the first dressing of his wound (inter primam <i>curationem</i> expiraverit).&mdash;<i>Livii

of the wound was attempted by the hand of a military comrade, or by that of
a surgeon. The same historian mentions that a few years later (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 483),
after the battle in which the Romans defeated the Hetrurians, the surviving
consul, M. Fabius, distributed his wounded soldiers, for the purpose of cure,
among the senators residing in Rome (saucios milites <i>curandos</i> dividit patribus).&mdash;See
<i>Livy</i>, lib. ii. cap. xlvii. And Tacitus, when describing the catastrophe
resulting from the fall of the amphitheatre at Fidena, in the reign of Tiberius,
states that those injured and wounded by the accident were received into the
houses of the citizens, and there carefully attended to, as (he adds) was the
custom in former times after great battles (veterum institutis similis, qui

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_386" id="Footnote_386"></a><a href="#FNanchor_386"><span class="label">386</span></a> Xiphilin gives the following account from Dion Cassius of the various
difficulties and disasters encountered by Severus, from the rivers, marshes,
woods, stratagems, etc., of the Caledonians:&mdash;&#8220;Severus, wishing to reduce the
whole island under his power, entered into Caledonia, and, in marching through
it, encountered the greatest difficulties; for he had to cut down woods, make
roads over mountains, mounds across the marshes, and bridges over the rivers.
He fought no battle, nor did he ever meet with the forces of the enemy in
array; but they advisedly placed sheep and oxen in the way of our troops, so
that when our soldiers attempted to seize the booty, and were thus drawn far
from the line of march, they were easily cut off. The waters and lakes, likewise,
were destructive to our men, as by dividing them they fell into the
ambuscades prepared for them; and when they could not be brought off, they
were slain by their comrades, that they might not fall into the hands of the
enemy. Owing to these causes there died not less than fifty thousand of our
troops.&#8221;&mdash;Xiphilin&#8217;s <i>Excerpta</i>, p. 305. Severus himself seems to have suffered
in his health during this Scottish campaign; for during the most of it, he required,
says Dion, to be carried, on account of his weakness, in a closed
litter (nam plurimum propter <i>imbecilitatem</i> operta lectica vehebatur&mdash;p. 305).
Both Dion (p. 307) and Herodian (p. 153) mention that he was disabled
by gout.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_387" id="Footnote_387"></a><a href="#FNanchor_387"><span class="label">387</span></a> Herodian&#8217;s account of the labours and difficulties of Severus in this campaign
sufficiently indicates the sources of malaria and disease to which his
army was subjected, and, at the same time, affords a curious statement regarding
the condition and habits of the ancient Caledonians:&mdash;&#8220;Severus&#8217; first
care (says Herodian) was to throw bridges across the morasses, that his soldiers
might be able to pursue the enemy over the dangerous places, and have the
opportunity of fighting on firm ground; for as the greater part of the island
is frequently overflowed by the tides, these constant inundations make the
country full of lakes and marshes. In these the barbarians swim, or wade
through them up to their middle, regardless of mud or dirt, as they always go
almost naked; for they are ignorant of the use of clothes, and only cover
their necks and bellies with fine plates of iron, which they esteem as an ornament
and sign of wealth, and are as proud of it as other barbarians are of
gold. They likewise dye their skins with the pictures of various kinds of
animals, which is one principal reason for their wearing no clothes, because
they are loath to hide the fine paintings on their bodies. But they are a very
warlike and fierce people, and arm only with a narrow shield and spear, and
a sword hanging by their naked bodies; unacquainted with the use of
habergeons and helmets, which they think would be an obstruction to their
wading through the ponds and marshes of their country, which, perpetually
sending up thick gross vapours, condense the air and make it always foggy.&#8221;&mdash;Hart&#8217;s
<i>Herodian</i>, pp. 153, 154. Dion Cassius, who lived at the date of
Severus&#8217; expedition, gives, when describing the expedition, an account of our
Caledonian ancestors that is in no degree more flattering. &#8220;The Caledonians,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;both possess rugged and dry mountains, and desert plains full
of marshes. They have neither castles nor towns; nor do they cultivate the
ground; but live on their flocks and hunting, and the fruits of some trees;
not eating fish, though extremely plenteous. They live in tents, naked, and
without buskins. Wives they have in common, and breed up their children
in common. The general form of government is democratic. They are
addicted to robbery; fight in cars; have small and swift horses. Their
infantry are remarkable for speed in running, and for firmness in standing.
Their armour consists of a shield, and a short spear, in the lower end of which
is a brazen apple, whose sound when struck may terrify the enemy. They have
also daggers. Famine, cold, and all sorts of labour they can bear, for they
will even stand in their marshes, for many days, up to the neck in water, and,
in the woods, will live on the bark and roots of trees. They prepare a certain
kind of food on all occasions, of which taking only a bit the size of a bean,
they feel neither hunger nor thirst.&#8221;&mdash;Xiphilin&#8217;s <i>Excerpta</i>, p. 304; and

&#8220;Notitia imperii&#8221; as located at the time at which that army-list was made out, at
three different military stations along the line of Hadrian&#8217;s wall from the
Tyne to the Solway; and various inscriptions raised by these troops have
been dug up in Northumberland and Cumberland. See Dr. Bruce&#8217;s work,
p. 47, 110 and 154. These English slabs all read <i>Asturum</i>, instead of the
<i>Astorum</i> of the Notitia, and of the Italian inscription referred to in the text.
Let me add that inscriptions referring to soldiers of the Ala Indiana or
Indian wing of auxiliary horsemen, have also been found in England.&mdash;See
an example in Mr. Akerman&#8217;s Arch&aelig;ological Index, p. 67, and Messrs Buckmann
and Newmarch&#8217;s Corinium, p. 115.</p></div>

as to months, as in the above tablet, and sometimes even as to days, is a
feature peculiar to Roman monumental inscriptions. And nothing appears
to us more strange and interesting in relation to Roman monumental tablets,
than their total or almost total silence as to a future state, and the possibility
of meeting beyond the grave. Out of the almost innumerable Roman monumental
inscriptions that have now been copied and published, not one, as far
as I am aware, ventures to refer to the hope of a future life. They seem to
have looked upon the idea of a future state of existence as poetical imagery
only, and not reality; all doubting, like Tacitus, &#8220;si quis piorum manibus

the stronger soldiers into the only available transport corps for the sick and
wounded. Xenophon speaks in the <i>Anabasis</i> (lib. iii. cap. iv.), of the number
of Greeks capable of fighting being diminished, because some soldiers were
employed in carrying the wounded, and others in carrying the arms of the
latter. One anecdote subsequently told by Xenophon seems to show that,
occasionally at least, if not as the common rule, one soldier was deemed
capable of carrying a sick or wounded companion. For he informs us, that
towards the end of the expedition, when publicly accused of being sometimes
too severe to the soldiers during the long retreat of the Greeks, the only
person who came forward to substantiate the charge, was a soldier whom he
had compelled to carry a sick comrade, and who, it turned out, had subsequently
dug a pit to bury the invalid before he was completely dead. The
army held that Xenophon had not beaten the complainant so much as he
actually deserved for this conduct.&mdash;<i>Anabasis</i>, lib. v. cap. 8.</p></div>

suicide at Utica, by stabbing himself in the abdomen, his friends rushed into
his room, on hearing him fall, and among them his attendant physician,
Cleanthes, who replaced the uninjured bowels, and began to staunch and sew
up the gash. But on recovering from his state of syncope, Cato thrust aside
the surgeon, tore asunder the wound, pulled out the entrails, and speedily
expired.&mdash;(See Plutarch&#8217;s Life of him, and Hirtius&#8217; <i>Commentar. De Bell.
Africano</i>, cap. 88.) Cicero and Seneca have written applaudingly of Cato&#8217;s
suicide. Lucan invests him with all godlike virtues; and various modern
writers have spoken in enthusiastic terms of his unbending moral dignity and
magnanimity of character. But one anecdote, mentioned by Plutarch, seems
calculated to detract not a little from our modern estimate of the mental
character of this &#8220;the last and greatest of the Romans.&#8221; In stabbing himself,
Cato could not, according to Plutarch, strike sufficiently hard to produce an
immediately fatal wound, in consequence of inflammation in his hand, which
had required to be dressed by Cleanthes; for a few hours before death, Cato,&mdash;that
alleged &#8220;paragon of Roman virtue,&#8221;&mdash;had severely injured his fist by
striking one of his slaves in the mouth with it.</p></div>

Aurelius died in Pannonia, when prosecuting a war against the German tribes.
Dion Cassius alludes to the physicians who were in attendance upon Aurelius
during this long campaign, when adverting to the report that the emperor&#8217;s
death was caused by them, in order to promote his son and successor Commodus
(&#8220;peremptus a <i>Medicis</i> qui Commodo gratificabantur.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Excerpta</i>, p. 252).
But Capitolinus, the principal authority regarding the biography of Aurelius,
does not even advert to the report. On the other hand, he describes Aurelius'
fatal illness as one of seven days&#8217; duration, and states that the emperor only
dismissed Commodus from his presence on the last day, lest he should communicate
the disease to him. (&#8220;Septimo die gravatus est; et solum filium

was one of the first, if not the first, act of cruelty which Caracalla committed
after Severus&#8217; death. Dion affirms that, after murdering his brother Geta, he
ordered about 20,000 of Geta&#8217;s supposed friends to be put to death; and amongst
others he condemned to death, according to Spartian, a class which is medically
not uninteresting&mdash;namely, all those who wore amulets or charms about their
necks for the cure of agues, a custom which would appear to have been much
in use both among the Greeks and Romans.&mdash;See Hart&#8217;s Herodian, p. 177.</p></div>

contrasted with our own, let me add (though the topic is not altogether
medical), that after Severus died at York, worn out, according to Herodian,
more by grief than by disease (moerore magis quam morbo consumptus), his
body was burned, and the ashes left by the corpse inclosed in an urn of
alabaster with perfumes (odoribus).&mdash;Herodian, p. 413. His sons, with their
own hands, lighted the funeral pile. Dion states that, shortly before his death,
Severus sent for the urn that was destined to contain his ashes, and addressed
it in terms too truly significant of the vanity and emptiness of the highest
earthly ambition and the greatest earthly success: &#8220;<i>Tu virum capies quem totus
orbis terrarum non cepit</i>.&#8221;&mdash;Dion, p. 307.</p></div>

staining the cicatrices of the eyes was suggested by the circumstance, that the

staining their eyebrows in the decorations of the toilet. On the substances
(<i>calliblephara</i>) used for this purpose, see Pliny, lib. xxiii. cap. 4, and lib. xxxv.

ingredients in a formula, preceded by the initial <span class="smcap lowercase">DIA</span>, was long retained in pharmaceutical
nomenclature. The London Pharmacop&oelig;ia of 1677, for instance,
has upwards of twenty medicines or formul&aelig; commencing with <span class="smcap lowecase">DIA</span>, as the
<i>Pulvis Diasenn&aelig;</i>, the <i>Electuarium Diacinnamomum</i>, the syrup named <i>Diacodium</i>,
etc. Almost the only remnant of this type of nomenclature that is
retained in modern medical language, is to be found in the well-known term
<i>Diachylon</i> plaster. The inventor of the <i>Diachylon</i> plaster&mdash;Menecrates&mdash;lived
about the time of Tiberius, and, according to the inscription still preserved at
Rome upon his marble tombstone (See Gruter&#8217;s <i>Inscriptiones</i>, p. 581), he was
the author of not less than 155 medical works, few or no fragments of which
remain. His plaster has greatly outlived the productions of his pen. The
medical poet, Damocrates, who wrote several pharmaceutical works, put Menecrates'
directions for preparing the <i>Diachylon</i> into Greek Iambic verse.&mdash;See

<p>Horace, in one of his odes addressed to Virgil (<i>Carmina</i>, lib. iv. c. 12), invites
his brother poet to a drinking-party, provided Virgil will earn his wine by
bringing some spikenard; and he declares that a small box of the perfume

<p>The <i>onyx</i>, or alabaster box, mentioned in these lines of Horace, was made of
a kind of gypsum, and was used for containing the more precious ointments,
under the belief, as we are told by Pliny (lib. xxxv. cap. 12), that this material
prevented the fragrance of the ointments from being dissipated (quoniam
optime servare incorrupta dicitur). In explanation of the great use of ointments
among the Romans, it is to be remembered that they then formed
their only vehicle for the enjoyment of perfumes, the art of distillation being
altogether unknown to them.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_572" id="Footnote_572"></a><a href="#FNanchor_572"><span class="label">572</span></a> Hildebrand states, that in the northern or Scandinavian districts of
Europe there have been found &#8220;Roman silver coins from about the middle
of the first to the commencement of the third century (Vespasianus to Severus
Alexander); but especially those of Hadrianus, Antoninus Pius, Aurelius,
and Commodus. Along with them,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;are sometimes found
various bronze articles, as statuettes, vases, and ornaments of various kinds
of Roman workmanship, and apparently of the same age. These coins, etc.,
are usually found about the islands of Gothland and Oland, and in Scan&iuml;a.
The coins are worn and clipped, so that often the legends and reverses are
defaced, and the portrait alone tells by whom they were struck. The reason
of this is (he suggests), that the coins came to the north after long voyages.
As the Roman eagles were never planted on Swedish soil, these coins, etc.,
must either have been brought by the northern pirates from Roman possessions,
or by merchants trading with Roman subjects. Only one gold coin (of
Titus), and one ? (of Faustina the elder), are as yet known to have been
found in the North.&#8221; See Hildebrand&#8217;s <i>Monnaies Anglo-Saxonnes du Cabinet

observations:&mdash;&#8220;At the mine in Cyprus, in the mountains of the Soli, there
was a great cave dug in the mountain, at the right side of which, that is to
say, on our left hand as we entered, there was a passage into the mine, in
which I saw certain specimens of the three substances stretched upon one
another like zones, the lowest being that of <i>sori</i>, upon it <i>chalcitis</i>, and then
that of <i>misy</i>. In process of time the chalcitis changes into misy by degrees,
and the sori can change into chalcitis, but requires a much longer space of
time. So that it is no wonder that these three substances should be
possessed of homogeneous (similar) powers, as differing from one another in
tenuity and density of their parts&mdash;the grossest being the sori, and the
finest the misy, whereas chalcitis possesses an intermediate power. When
burnt, they become more attenuant, but less styptic.&#8221;&mdash;Adams&#8217; <i>Paulus

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_586" id="Footnote_586"></a><a href="#FNanchor_586"><span class="label">586</span></a> Perhaps this incantation was but a remnant of that ophite worship
which appears to have in former times prevailed so generally throughout the
world. On the ancient extent of serpent-worship in the old world, see
Stukeley&#8217;s <i>Abury</i>, p. 32; Colonel Tod&#8217;s <i>History of Rajasthan</i>; the Rev. J.
B. Deane&#8217;s learned Treatise on the Worship of the Serpent, and his observations
on various ancient Dracontia, or ophite temples in England, France,
etc., in the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, vol. xxv. p. 180, etc. Latterly, the observations
of Mr. Squier would seem to show that the same type of worship was, in
long past times, diffused as extensively over the new world. (See his late
work, entitled <i>Serpent Symbol, and the Worship of the Reciprocal Principles of
Nature in America</i>.) The supposed connection of the serpent and serpent-worship
with the healing art has been handed down to us emblematically
in the serpent symbol with which the caduceus of &AElig;sculapius is always
represented as surrounded. The Romans regarded the serpent as a symbol
of health, and we find it figured as such on some of the coins of Augustus
and Claudian.</p></div>

at the &#8220;sacred&#8221; Councils of the Church showed, perhaps, in these
days, little or no amendment upon the morals of Rome itself. At the great
Council of Constance, for example, held in the fifteenth century, there were,
according to the long list of those present, as given by Lenfant, &#8220;seven
hundred common women&#8221; whose habitations were known to Ducher; whilst
the Vienna list of the same Council sets down the list of &#8220;meretrices vagabund&aelig;&#8221;
as fifteen hundred in number (Lenfant&#8217;s <i>History of the Council of
Constance</i>, vol. iv. pp. 414, 416). This Council was summoned together by
that misnamed &#8220;Vicegerent of God on earth,&#8221; Pope John XXIII., a man
who, according to his own secretary, Thierry de Niem, was guilty of &#8220;all the
mortal sins, and of a multitude of abominable acts not fit to be named&#8221;
(Niem <i>de Vita Joh. XXIII.</i>, ap. Von&#8217;der Hardt, tom. ii. p. 391.) Among
other matters, the Procurators of the Council publicly accused him before it
of &#8220;cum uxore fratris sui, et cum sanctis monialibus incestum, cum virginibus
stuprum, et cum conjugatis adulterium, et alia incontinentiae crimina&#8221;
(Concil. Constan. Sess. xi., Binius, tom. iii. p. 874). Yet this same &#8220;infallible&#8221;
Council of Constance, as it termed itself, called together, as it was, professedly
for the cure of the evils and doctrines of the Church and Papacy, principally
distinguished itself in history by burning John Huss and Jerome of Prague
for preaching from the Scriptures the pure and simple gospel of Jesus Christ.

dark times shows us, however, occasional bright and isolated glimpses of the
existence of true Christianity in general society and in the cloisters. In the
personal history of Luther, for example, few circumstances are more interesting
than the fact of Staupitz, the Vicar-General of the Order of Augustine
Monks of Germany, earnestly and tenderly assisting the young and distressed
monk of Erfurth to arrive at a knowledge of salvation by faith alone (as laid
down in the Scriptures&mdash;a copy of which he presented to him), and not by
works.</p></div>
